Results land as fast as you can type. A Rust core under a native SwiftUI app on macOS, and Tauri on Windows and Linux, riding the system WebView instead of shipping a browser like Electron does. No background daemons. Your index, clipboard, and history stay on your machine; no telemetry.

## Install

### macOS

```bash
brew install --cask look
```

Then bind `Cmd+Space` to Look (disable Spotlight's shortcut in `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Spotlight`), or pick another shortcut with `launcher_hotkey` in `~/.look/config`. Release builds are signed and notarized - no Gatekeeper bypass needed.

### Linux

Released artifacts are **x86_64 only**. ARM builds aren't published; if you need one, please open an issue.

**Arch Linux (AUR):**

```bash
yay -S look-bin
# or
paru -S look-bin
```

Or without an AUR helper:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/look-bin.git
cd look-bin
makepkg -si
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunkka19xx/look/main/scripts/linux/install-look.sh | bash
```

Or download the `.deb` manually from [Releases](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/releases) and run `sudo dpkg -i Look_*.deb`.

**Any distro (AppImage):**

```bash
chmod +x Look_*.AppImage
./Look_*.AppImage
```

After installing, launch with `lookapp` from a terminal, or search "Look" in your app launcher. Press `Alt+Space` to toggle the window at any time. To bind your own key instead, set `launcher_hotkey=none` in `~/.look/config`, restart Look, and bind `lookapp --toggle` in your desktop settings. Look autostarts on login by default (on full DEs like GNOME/KDE).

Uninstall:

```bash
# Arch
yay -R look-bin

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dpkg -r look

# AppImage - just delete the file
rm Look_*.AppImage
```

**NixOS (flake):**

```bash
# Run directly
nix run 'github:kunkka19xx/look?dir=apps/linows'

# Install to profile
nix profile install 'github:kunkka19xx/look?dir=apps/linows'
```

Declarative (NixOS):

```nix
# flake.nix - add input and cachix config
{
  nixConfig = {
    extra-substituters = [ "https://look.cachix.org" ];
    extra-trusted-public-keys = [ "look.cachix.org-1:8elPCeSVBzlDZXqIRKBK9GyLIK/Hoe1xiWZF0ir7uX4=" ];
  };

  inputs.look.url = "github:kunkka19xx/look?dir=apps/linows";
  # ... your other inputs
}

# configuration.nix - add package
{ pkgs, inputs, ... }:
{
  environment.systemPackages = [
    inputs.look.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
  ];
}
```

Pre-built binaries are served via [Cachix](https://look.cachix.org). On first rebuild, nix will ask to trust the cache - say yes. No source compilation needed.

Update to latest release:

```bash
nix flake update look --flake /path/to/your/flake
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /path/to/your/flake#hostname
```

> **Note:** On GNOME desktops, log out and log back in after the first install so the GNOME Shell extension (used for window focusing and hotkey on Wayland) can load.

**Window manager users (i3, sway, Hyprland, niri, etc.):** Autostart via `.desktop` files only works on full DEs (GNOME, KDE). On standalone WMs, add Look to your config manually. On i3, sway, and Hyprland the `Alt+Space` hotkey and window rules (float, no border) are registered automatically at runtime, so you only need the autostart line; niri needs the bind added by hand (see below):

```bash
# i3: ~/.config/i3/config
exec --no-startup-id lookapp
# (Alt+Space works via X11 global shortcut plugin)

# sway: ~/.config/sway/config
exec lookapp
# (Alt+Space, float, and border rules are injected automatically via swaymsg)

# Hyprland: ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
exec-once = lookapp
# (Alt+Space, float, and border rules are injected automatically via hyprctl)
```

niri has no API to add binds at runtime, so `Alt+Space` has to go in `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` yourself, or in any file that config includes. Look shows the exact stanza for your system (the `gdbus` path differs on NixOS) in its setup notice on first run:

```kdl
spawn-at-startup "lookapp"

binds {
    Alt+Space allow-inhibiting=false { spawn "gdbus" "call" "--session" "--dest" "com.look.Desktop" "--object-path" "/com/look/Desktop" "--method" "com.look.Desktop.Toggle"; }
}
```

`allow-inhibiting=false` matters: without it niri passes the key to a window holding a keyboard-shortcuts inhibitor, which fullscreen games, browsers and virtual machines all take, and Look never opens over them.

Any key works, it is the same `spawn` line: Look only ever sees the D-Bus call. Bind a key niri already uses (`Mod+D` spawns fuzzel in the default config) and niri rejects the whole config as a duplicate keybind, keeping the last good one, so drop the existing bind first and check with `niri validate`, or `niri --config <path> validate` if you start niri with `-c`. The setup notice names the file Look actually read, which is that `-c` path, then `NIRI_CONFIG`, then `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`, then `/etc/niri/config.kdl` - niri loads one of them and never merges.

Floating is applied at runtime over niri's IPC; add a rule only if you also want the focus ring and shadow off:

```kdl
window-rule {
    match app-id="^lookapp$"
    open-floating true
    focus-ring { off; }
    shadow { off; }
}
```

> **Hyprland 0.55+ only.** Focus-existing-window uses the `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` protocol. Older Hyprland versions relied on the legacy `hyprctl dispatch focuswindow` syntax which was deprecated in 0.55; selecting an already-running app on <0.55 may launch a second instance instead of focusing. Upgrade to 0.55+ for correct behavior.

To build from source, see [apps/linows/BUILDING.md](apps/linows/BUILDING.md).

### Windows

Released artifacts are **x86_64 only**. Windows on ARM (Surface Pro X / Snapdragon X) can run the x64 build under emulation; native ARM builds aren't published - open an issue if you need one.

One PowerShell line, no admin required:

```powershell
iex "& { $(irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunkka19xx/look/main/scripts/windows/install-look.ps1) }"
```

Or with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (if you already have it installed):

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/look
```

The script resolves the latest release, downloads the NSIS installer, verifies its SHA256 against the published checksums, and runs it silently into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Look`. SmartScreen will warn on the first download while reputation builds - click "More info → Run anyway" if Windows blocks the script itself.

Uninstall:

```powershell
# Scoop
scoop uninstall look

# Installer script
iex "& { $(irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunkka19xx/look/main/scripts/windows/install-look.ps1) } -Uninstall"

# Optional: wipe user data
Remove-Item -Recurse "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\look"
```

The launcher's global hotkey defaults to `Alt+Space`; set `launcher_hotkey` in `~/.look/config` (for example `launcher_hotkey=ctrl+space`) to change it, then reload with `Ctrl+Shift+;`. For a manual install: download `Look_<version>_x64-setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/releases/latest), verify the SHA256 against the published `Look-<version>-windows-checksums.txt`, then run. Uninstall via Settings → Apps or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Look\uninstall.exe`. To wipe user data: `Remove-Item -Recurse "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\look"`.

<details>
<summary>Other install options (curl, pin version, update/uninstall)</summary>

**macOS - Homebrew update / uninstall:**

```bash
# update
brew upgrade --cask look

# uninstall
brew uninstall --cask look
```

**macOS - curl installer:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunkka19xx/look/main/scripts/install-look.sh | bash
```

Pin a specific version or repo fork:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunkka19xx/look/main/scripts/install-look.sh | bash -s -- --version <version> --repo kunkka19xx/look
```

Direct URL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunkka19xx/look/main/scripts/install-look.sh | bash -s -- --url "https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/releases/download/v<version>/Look-<version>-macOS.zip"
```

CLI naming note: macOS ships `/usr/bin/look`, so terminal command examples use `lookapp`.

If Look is fully quit and Spotlight is still unbound, relaunch from Launchpad, or via:

```bash
open "/Applications/Look.app"
```

(Throughout the rest of the docs, `Cmd+X` on macOS maps to `Ctrl+X` on Windows and Linux; the launcher-toggle hotkey uses `Alt+Space` on Windows/Linux instead of `Cmd+Space` because `Win+Space` / `Super+Space` are typically reserved by the OS or desktop environment.)

`Cmd+E` and `Cmd+T` need a tool named in `~/.look/config` (`text_editor`, `code_editor`, `terminal`), and `file_manager` retargets `Cmd+F`. Declare nothing and each falls back to the system default: see [Preferred tools](docs/user-guide.md#preferred-tools).

Which super actions are on the strip, where they sit, and any tiles of your own is a drawing in `~/.look/super-actions.toml`, seeded on first run: see [Super actions](docs/user-guide.md#super-actions).

## Themes

Built-in: Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Rose Pine, Gruvbox, Dracula, Kanagawa, Kindle, Liquid, plus Custom.
Kindle is the one light preset - paper, ink, and a serif face.
Liquid renders on macOS 26's Liquid Glass and is hidden on older releases; on Linux and Windows it ships as clear glass - same palette and geometry, a specular rim instead of refraction, plus real behind-window blur wherever the compositor grants it (KDE, Hyprland 0.56+, Niri).
Switch in `Settings > Appearance`.
