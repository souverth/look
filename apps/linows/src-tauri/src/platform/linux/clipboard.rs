//! Linux file clipboard: one copy that a file manager pastes as a file and a
//! text field pastes as a path.
//!
//! A clipboard advertises a *list* of types and the pasting app asks for the
//! one it understands, which is how macOS writes a URL and a string in a single
//! copy (`NSPasteboard.writeObjects([url, path])`). `wl-copy` and `xclip` each
//! advertise one type per invocation, so Look owns the clipboard itself through
//! GTK and answers whichever type is requested. They stay as the fallback for
//! the case where the grab fails.
