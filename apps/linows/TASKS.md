# linows — Implementation Tasks

Based on macOS app as source of truth. Organized by phase.

---

## Phase 1: Core Search (MVP)

### Scaffold
- [x] Create Tauri v2 project structure (src-tauri/, src/)
- [x] Cargo.toml with core crate deps (look-engine, look-indexing, look-storage)
- [x] tauri.conf.json (borderless, always-on-top, 860x580)
- [x] flake.nix dev shell with cargo-tauri
- [ ] Build script integration (Makefile targets)

### Backend (Rust)
- [x] `state.rs` — Engine cache (RwLock<QueryEngine>), bootstrap refresh, file watchers
- [x] `commands.rs` — search(query, limit), record_usage(id, action)
- [x] `commands.rs` — open_path(path, kind, id), reveal_path(path)
- [x] `commands.rs` — reload_config(), request_index_refresh()
- [x] `commands.rs` — get_file_meta(path), get_app_version(path), get_home_dir()
- [x] `platform.rs` — Icon extraction (freedesktop theme + XDG_DATA_DIRS, .desktop Icon= parsing)
- [x] App launching — gtk-launch → gio launch → direct spawn, focus existing window via swaymsg/hyprctl/i3-msg/x11rb/GNOME ext
- [x] Settings URL handling — settings:// paths routed through gnome-control-center (D-Bus + fallback); hidden on non-GNOME DEs

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- [x] `index.html` — Main window structure
- [x] `css/reset.css` — CSS reset
- [x] `css/theme.css` — CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, typography)
- [x] `css/layout.css` — Window layout, search bar, content area
- [x] `css/components/` — Per-component CSS (results, preview, picked)
- [x] `js/ipc.js` — Tauri invoke wrapper
- [x] `js/app.js` — Main controller, mode switching
- [x] `js/search.js` — Debounced search (70ms), query → invoke → render, quick folders
- [x] `js/components/results.js` — Result rows, icons, pick state management
- [x] `js/components/preview.js` — Preview panel (icon, title, badge, metadata, image preview)
- [x] `js/components/picked.js` — Picked items panel (header, list, remove buttons)
- [x] `js/keyboard.js` — Arrow/Tab/Shift+Tab navigation, Enter/Ctrl+Enter, Escape, wrap-around

### Window & System
- [x] Global hotkey (Alt+Space) via tauri-plugin-global-shortcut (X11), D-Bus + compositor IPC (Wayland)
- [x] Single instance via tauri-plugin-single-instance
- [x] Transparency detection (Wayland/compositor → transparent + rounded corners, X11 bare → solid + square)
- [x] Auto-hide on focus loss (transparent-capable platforms only)
- [x] i3/tiling WM support (floating rule, manual centering)
- [x] Sway/Hyprland support (auto-inject keybinding + window rules via swaymsg/hyprctl at runtime)

---

## Phase 2: Preview & Multi-pick

### Screens
- [x] Result preview panel — file metadata (size, modified, path), image preview, app version
- [x] Picked items panel — list of multi-selected items with remove buttons

### Features
- [x] Quick folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Videos, Music)
- [x] Multi-pick (Ctrl+P toggle, Ctrl+Shift+P clear all)

- [x] Reveal in file manager (Ctrl+F)
- [x] Hint bar (bottom status text)
- [x] Web search (Ctrl+Enter) — opens Google search in default browser

---

## Phase 3: Clipboard & Commands

### Screens
- [x] Clipboard history view — list of entries with time, char/line count, preview panel
- [x] Command mode panel — 5 commands (calc, pomo, kill, shell, sys) with sidebar + shared input
- [x] Kill confirmation bar — app icon, name, PID, Y/N at bottom
- [x] Translation panel — 3 languages (EN/VI/JA), copy per result, open in browser
- [ ] Banner notifications (animated toast messages)

### Features
- [x] Clipboard history store (in-memory ring buffer, max 10 entries, 30KB each, persisted)

## Phase 4: Settings & Themes

### Screens

- [x] Dracula
- [x] Kanagawa
- [x] Custom (auto-switches when user edits sliders)

### Features
- [x] Theme switching via CSS custom properties on :root
- [x] Theme presets drive slider values; editing any slider auto-switches to "Custom"
- [x] Background image support (pick image, layout modes, opacity, blur overlay)
- [x] Blur material options (balanced, high_contrast, soft) — platform-aware
- [x] Platform detection (get_platform) — OS + compositor detection
- [x] Window effects (set_window_effect) — Mica/Acrylic on Windows, CSS backdrop-filter on Linux

- [x] Font scale control (slider)
- [x] Config file persistence (.look.config format, shared with macOS)
- [x] Dynamic window scaling — 1.0x at 1080p, 1.2x at 1440p, 1.3x max
- [x] Auto-start registration (Linux .desktop autostart, enabled by default on first launch)

- [x] System settings detection — only show settings entries on GNOME-based DEs with gnome-control-center
- [ ] UWP app seeding (Windows — enumerate shell:AppsFolder via PowerShell)

---

## Backlog / Improvements

- [x] Linux settings handling — detect GNOME DE + `gnome-control-center` at index time; skip settings on sway/Hyprland/i3/minimal
- [] Hyrpland gnome alt-space toggle
- [] Arch gnome startup issue: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER
- [x] Hyprland: ghosted/doubled rendering in Settings — disable `backdrop-filter` and force near-opaque tint when `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` is set
- [x] Arch GNOME 50 + webkit 2.52.3: same ghost rendering as Hyprland, but Ubuntu 26.04 / NixOS 2.50.6 on identical webkit are unaffected → can't auto-detect. Added two opt-in toggles under Advanced > Arch: `arch_disable_gpu` (keeps blur, sets `HardwareAccelerationPolicy::Never`, needs restart) and `arch_disable_blur` (live; Hyprland-style fallback). Both default off.
- [x] Hyprland/Wayland: toggle flicker ("big rect without corners → snap to smaller with corners") — set GTK window bg to transparent and lock `min_size`/`max_size` so hide/show doesn't revert to `tauri.conf` default
- [ ] Multi-monitor: toggle no longer rescales to the current monitor's DPI mid-session (resize was removed from the toggle path to avoid Wayland configure-cycle jank). Add a monitor-change listener to re-scale on demand if this becomes a real-world issue.
- [ ] Sway/wlroots: monitor whether the same WebKitGTK backdrop-filter ghosting affects Sway; extend the Hyprland CSS workaround to `[data-compositor="sway"]` if reported.
- [ ] Identify what specifically in Arch's stack triggers the webkit ghost bug (GTK 3.24.49? mutter 50? mesa version?) by collecting a second Arch-with-ghost report and diffing component versions vs unaffected stacks (Ubuntu 26.04, NixOS 2.50.6). If pinpointed, auto-enable the relevant Arch toggle for affected combinations.
- [ ] KDE settings support — detect `systemsettings` and add KDE-specific settings catalog
- [ ] Minimal DE settings — map to standalone tools (pavucontrol, arandr, blueman-manager) on i3/sway
- [ ] Some DBUS single-instance apps (blueman-manager, fcitx5-config) fail to launch — known limitation
- [ ] GNOME Wayland: dock icon visible while Look is open — Tauri sets skip_taskbar_hint async (too late). Contributions welcome.
- [ ] macOS: dynamic window scaling based on monitor resolution (match linows — 1.0x at 1080p, 1.2x at 1440p, 1.3x max)
- [ ] Configurable global hotkey — let users change the toggle shortcut (default Alt+Space) via settings
- [ ] Structured logging — wire up Backend Log Level setting (error/warn/info/debug) to control output; replace `eprintln!` with proper log macros
- [ ] Tests — add unit/integration tests for backend modules (calc, config, autostart, process, sysinfo, clipboard, shell)

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows
- Window blur: Mica/Acrylic via Tauri WindowEffectsConfig
- Icons: SHGetFileInfo or windows-rs shell APIs
- UWP apps: PowerShell enumeration → seed_uwp_apps command
- Auto-start: Registry HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- DB path: %LOCALAPPDATA%/look/look.db

### Linux
- Window blur: Compositor-dependent; fallback to solid dark background
- Icons: freedesktop-icons crate + MIME type detection
- Apps: .desktop file scanning in /usr/share/applications, ~/.local/share/applications
- Auto-start: ~/.config/autostart/look.desktop
- DB path: ~/.local/share/look/look.db
- Global hotkey: X11 via tauri-plugin-global-shortcut; Wayland via D-Bus service + compositor-specific keybinding (GNOME gsettings, Sway swaymsg, Hyprland hyprctl)
- Window focus: Sway via swaymsg [app_id], Hyprland via hyprctl dispatch, GNOME via Shell extension, X11 via x11rb/i3-msg
- i3/tiling WMs: needs `exec lookapp` in config; sway/Hyprland auto-inject window rules at runtime
- Audio: rodio → cpal → ALSA (works on all distros, PulseAudio/PipeWire provide ALSA compat)
- Folder picker: tauri-plugin-dialog (uses xdg-desktop-portal on portal-enabled desktops, GTK fallback)
- NixOS: needs alsa-lib in buildInputs, xdg-desktop-portal-gtk for folder picker
