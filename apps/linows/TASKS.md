# linows — Implementation Tasks

Based on macOS app as source of truth. Organized by phase.

---

## Phase 1: Core Search (MVP)

### Scaffold
- [x] Create Tauri v2 project structure (src-tauri/, src/)
- [x] Cargo.toml with core crate deps (look-engine, look-indexing, look-storage)
- [x] tauri.conf.json (borderless, always-on-top, 860x580)
- [x] flake.nix dev shell with cargo-tauri
- [ ] Build script integration (Makefile targets)

### Backend (Rust)
- [x] `state.rs` — Engine cache (RwLock<QueryEngine>), bootstrap refresh, file watchers
- [x] `commands.rs` — search(query, limit), record_usage(id, action)
- [x] `commands.rs` — open_path(path, kind, id), reveal_path(path)
- [x] `commands.rs` — reload_config(), request_index_refresh()
- [x] `commands.rs` — get_file_meta(path), get_app_version(path), get_home_dir()
- [x] `platform.rs` — Icon extraction (freedesktop theme + XDG_DATA_DIRS, .desktop Icon= parsing)
- [x] App launching — gio launch → gtk-launch → direct spawn, focus existing window via i3-msg/xdotool
- [x] Settings URL handling — settings:// paths routed through xdg-open

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- [x] `index.html` — Main window structure
- [x] `css/reset.css` — CSS reset
- [x] `css/theme.css` — CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, typography)
- [x] `css/layout.css` — Window layout, search bar, content area
- [x] `css/components/` — Per-component CSS (results, preview, picked)
- [x] `js/ipc.js` — Tauri invoke wrapper
- [x] `js/app.js` — Main controller, mode switching
- [x] `js/search.js` — Debounced search (70ms), query → invoke → render, quick folders
- [x] `js/components/results.js` — Result rows, icons, pick state management
- [x] `js/components/preview.js` — Preview panel (icon, title, badge, metadata, image preview)
- [x] `js/components/picked.js` — Picked items panel (header, list, remove buttons)
- [x] `js/keyboard.js` — Arrow/Tab/Shift+Tab navigation, Enter/Ctrl+Enter, Escape, wrap-around

### Window & System
- [x] Global hotkey (Alt+Space) via tauri-plugin-global-shortcut
- [x] Single instance via tauri-plugin-single-instance
- [x] Transparency detection (Wayland/compositor → transparent + rounded corners, X11 bare → solid + square)
- [x] Auto-hide on focus loss (transparent-capable platforms only)
- [x] i3/tiling WM support (floating rule, manual centering)

---

## Phase 2: Preview & Multi-pick

### Screens

### Features
- [x] Quick folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Videos, Music)
- [x] Multi-pick (Ctrl+P toggle, Ctrl+Shift+P clear all)

---

## Phase 3: Clipboard & Commands

### Screens
- [x] Clipboard history view — list of entries with time, char/line count, preview panel
- [x] Command mode panel — 5 commands (calc, pomo, kill, shell, sys) with sidebar + shared input
- [x] Kill confirmation bar — app icon, name, PID, Y/N at bottom
- [x] Translation panel — 3 languages (EN/VI/JA), copy per result, open in browser
- [ ] Banner notifications (animated toast messages)

### Features
- [x] Clipboard history store (in-memory ring buffer, max 10 entries, 30KB each, persisted)
- [x] Clipboard monitoring (arboard polling, skips Look's own writes)
- [x] `c"` prefix to browse clipboard history
- [x] Delete individual clipboard entries
- [x] Command mode toggle (Ctrl+/)
- [x] Calculator command — full parity with macOS (functions, constants, factorial, %, formatting)
- [x] Shell command — execute and capture output (<800 chars, 10s timeout)
- [x] Kill command — running GUI apps list with icons, filter, confirm + kill
- [x] System info command — structured table (OS, memory, CPU, battery, uptime, disk)
- [x] Pomodoro timer — configurable sessions, 3 timer styles, idle standby mode, bg music (rodio)
- [x] Pomo music player — folder picker, shuffle, prev/next/play/pause, auto-advance
- [x] Context-sensitive hint bar — per-command keyboard hints at bottom
- [ ] Kill by port (`:3000` syntax)
- [x] Translation (`t"` prefix) — web translation via Google Translate (curl)
- [x] Language selection (English, Vietnamese, Japanese) — all 3 shown simultaneously

---

## Phase 4: Settings & Themes

### Screens
- [x] Settings panel (Ctrl+Shift+,) with 3 tabs:
  - [x] Appearance tab — theme, tint color, blur, font (name+size+autocomplete), font color, border
  - [x] Shortcuts tab — keyboard shortcut reference (read-only)
  - [x] Advanced tab — config path, index refresh, scan depth/limit
- [x] Help screen (Ctrl+H) — 3 sections (navigation, commands, settings)

### Themes (CSS custom property sets)
- [x] Catppuccin (default)
- [x] Tokyo Night
- [x] Rose Pine
- [x] Gruvbox
- [x] Dracula
- [x] Kanagawa
- [x] Custom (auto-switches when user edits sliders)

### Features
- [x] Theme switching via CSS custom properties on :root
- [x] Theme presets drive slider values; editing any slider auto-switches to "Custom"
- [x] Background image support (pick image, layout modes, opacity, blur overlay)
- [x] Blur material options (balanced, high_contrast, soft) — platform-aware
- [x] Platform detection (get_platform) — OS + compositor detection
- [x] Window effects (set_window_effect) — Mica/Acrylic on Windows, CSS backdrop-filter on Linux
- [x] Font name autocomplete from system fonts (fc-list on Linux)
- [x] Font scale control (slider)
- [x] Config file persistence (.look.config format, shared with macOS)
- [x] Dynamic window scaling — 1.0x at 1080p, 1.2x at 1440p, 1.3x max
- [ ] Auto-start registration (Windows registry, Linux .desktop autostart)
- [ ] UWP app seeding (Windows — enumerate shell:AppsFolder via PowerShell)

---

## Backlog / Improvements

- [ ] Linux settings handling — detect DE (GNOME/KDE/minimal):
  - GNOME/KDE: `settings://` URLs work via `gnome-control-center` / `systemsettings`
  - Minimal (i3/sway/X11 bare): map to standalone tools (pavucontrol, arandr, blueman-manager, etc.) or hide settings entries
  - Detect via `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `DESKTOP_SESSION`, or presence of `gnome-control-center`
- [ ] Some DBUS single-instance apps (blueman-manager, fcitx5-config) fail to launch — known limitation
- [ ] macOS: dynamic window scaling based on monitor resolution (match linows — 1.0x at 1080p, 1.2x at 1440p, 1.3x max)
- [ ] Configurable global hotkey — let users change the toggle shortcut (default Alt+Space) via settings

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows
- Window blur: Mica/Acrylic via Tauri WindowEffectsConfig
- Icons: SHGetFileInfo or windows-rs shell APIs
- UWP apps: PowerShell enumeration → seed_uwp_apps command
- Auto-start: Registry HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- DB path: %LOCALAPPDATA%/look/look.db

### Linux
- Window blur: Compositor-dependent; fallback to solid dark background
- Icons: freedesktop-icons crate + MIME type detection
- Apps: .desktop file scanning in /usr/share/applications, ~/.local/share/applications
- Auto-start: ~/.config/autostart/look.desktop
- DB path: ~/.local/share/look/look.db
- Global hotkey: Works on X11; Wayland support may be limited
- i3/tiling WMs: needs `for_window [title="Look"] floating enable, border none` in config
- Audio: rodio → cpal → ALSA (works on all distros, PulseAudio/PipeWire provide ALSA compat)
- Folder picker: tauri-plugin-dialog (uses xdg-desktop-portal on portal-enabled desktops, GTK fallback)
- NixOS: needs alsa-lib in buildInputs, xdg-desktop-portal-gtk for folder picker
