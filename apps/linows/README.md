# linows

Tauri v2 desktop app for **Windows + Linux**. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

The macOS SwiftUI app (`apps/macos/`) is the design source of truth — this app replicates
its look, feel, and feature set using web technologies.

## Architecture

```
apps/linows/
  src-tauri/             Rust backend (Tauri commands, state, platform logic)
    src/
      main.rs            Entry point, plugin registration, global hotkey
      commands.rs        Search, open, reveal, window, quit
      state.rs           AppState (engine cache, file watchers, index refresh)
      config.rs          Config get/set (.look.config persistence)

      translate.rs       Translation
      autostart.rs       Autostart management
      platform/          Platform-specific code
        linux/           Icons, WM detection, Wayland shortcuts, GNOME ext, …
        windows/         Icons, effects, drives, known folders, …
        shared.rs        Shared platform helpers
    capabilities/
      default.json       Tauri v2 permissions (events, dialog)
  src/                   Vanilla frontend (served by Tauri webview)
    index.html
    css/                 reset.css, layout.css, theme.css
    js/
      app.js             Main controller, mode switching

    html/screens/        HTML templates (search, settings, help, commands)
    assets/              Icons
```

## Why This Exists

The previous Windows app (`apps/windows/`) was built with WinUI3/C#. It didn't match the
macOS app's look and feel — the UI felt inconsistent across platforms. This Tauri app
replaces it with a web-based frontend that can look identical on Windows and Linux, using
the macOS SwiftUI app as the single design reference.

The WinUI3 app remains in `apps/windows/` (bug fixes only) until this migration is complete.

## Key Decisions

- Direct Rust crate deps (no FFI/cdylib) — Tauri commands call core engine directly
- Own Cargo workspace (not part of core/ workspace)
- ES modules (`<script type="module">`) — no bundler
- CSS custom properties for theming
- macOS design language: dark, blurred, rounded, minimal
- Audio playback via `rodio` (Rust) — WebKitGTK's HTML5 Audio has issues on Linux
- Folder picker via `tauri-plugin-dialog` — cross-platform native dialogs
- Tauri v2 capabilities in `capabilities/default.json` for event/dialog permissions

## Linux Desktop Environments

| Environment   | Distro | Status   | Notes                                                   |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| GNOME Xorg    | NixOS  | Tested   | Full support                                            |
| GNOME Wayland | Ubuntu | Tested   | Dock icon visible while Look is open (see Known Issues) |
| GNOME Wayland | NixOS  | Tested   | Full support                                            |
| GNOME Wayland | Arch   | Tested   | Full support                                            |
| i3 X11        | NixOS  | Tested   | No system settings entries                              |
| Sway          | NixOS  | Tested   | No system settings entries                              |
| Hyprland      | Arch   | Tested   | No system settings entries                              |
| KDE Plasma    |        | Untested |                                                         |

**System settings** (Appearance, Wi-Fi, Sound, etc.) are only shown when `gnome-control-center`
is detected. On i3, sway, or minimal distros without GNOME, these entries are skipped.

## Optional Dependencies

| Package        | Used for                          | Fallback                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `xclip`        | Copy files to clipboard (X11)     | Shows "Copy failed" banner |
| `wl-clipboard` | Copy files to clipboard (Wayland) | Shows "Copy failed" banner |

Text clipboard (copy path, clipboard history) works without any external tools.
File clipboard (copy a file to paste into a file manager) needs one of the above.

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install xclip              # X11
sudo apt install wl-clipboard       # Wayland

# Fedora
sudo dnf install xclip              # X11
sudo dnf install wl-clipboard       # Wayland

# Arch
sudo pacman -S xclip                # X11
sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard         # Wayland
```

## Build

```bash
cd apps/linows
cargo tauri dev       # development
cargo tauri build     # production
```

**NixOS dev shell** (uses flake.nix):

```bash
nix develop
cargo tauri dev
cargo tauri build --bundles deb    # build .deb package
```

## Testing on Ubuntu VM (virt-manager)

**Build .deb on NixOS host:**

```bash
nix develop --command cargo tauri build --bundles deb
# Output: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Look_*.deb
```

**Get VM IP** (on the VM):

```bash
ip addr | grep inet
# Look for 192.168.122.x on enp1s0
```

**Prerequisites on VM** (first time only):

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server patchelf
```

**Deploy** (from host, run as one script):

```bash
scp -O apps/linows/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Look_*.deb kunkka@192.168.122.x:/tmp/
```

**Install on VM:**

```bash
pkill lookapp                              # stop running instance
sudo dpkg -r look && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/Look_*.deb
sudo patchelf --set-interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/bin/lookapp
lookapp                                    # launch from terminal to see logs
```

> **Why?** NixOS builds link against `/nix/store/.../ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` which doesn't
> exist on Ubuntu/Debian. `patchelf` rewrites it to the standard `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`.
> Without this, the binary shows `cannot execute: required file not found`.
> For proper release builds, use Ubuntu/Debian CI or add a patchelf step to the build script.

**VM without GPU** (no `/dev/dri` or virtual GPU driver): the app auto-detects this and
disables hardware acceleration via the WebKitGTK API (`set_hardware_acceleration_policy(Never)`).

**GNOME Shell extension** requires log out/in after first install to load.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

| Shortcut      | Action                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Alt+Space     | Toggle Look window      |
| Esc           | Hide Look               |
| Alt+Shift+Q   | Quit Look               |
| Tab/Shift+Tab | Navigate results        |
| Enter         | Open selected           |
| Ctrl+Enter    | Search web              |
| Ctrl+C        | Copy path to clipboard  |
| Ctrl+F        | Reveal in file manager  |
| Ctrl+P        | Pick (multi-select)     |
| Ctrl+Shift+P  | Clear all picks         |
| Ctrl+/        | Toggle command mode     |
| Ctrl+Shift+,  | Open settings           |
| Ctrl+Shift+;  | Reload config from file |
| Ctrl+H        | Help screen             |

**Known issues on Ubuntu:**

- GNOME's default Alt+Space (window menu) is auto-disabled by Look on Wayland; restored when Look exits
- **GNOME Wayland: dock icon visible while Look is open.** Tauri sets `skip_taskbar_hint`
  asynchronously after the GTK window is mapped, so GNOME's dock ignores it. Native GTK apps
  like Ulauncher set this hint in the constructor (before mapping), which works. On X11, the
  hint works correctly. The icon disappears when Look is hidden (Esc / Alt+Space).
  **Contributions welcome** — if you know a way to set GTK hints before Tauri maps the window,
  please open a PR!

  **Workaround — hide running app indicators from the dock:**

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu Dock
  gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.ubuntu-dock show-running false

  # Dash to Dock
  gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock show-running false

  # Undo: replace 'false' with 'true'
  ```

**For dev in VM (nixos)**

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 cargo tauri dev
```

**Known issue on Arch — ghost slider trails / overlapping popovers:**

On some Arch installs (observed on GNOME 50 + webkit2gtk 2.52.3 + GTK 3.24.49), dragging a
slider in Settings leaves a trail of past thumb positions, and the theme dropdown shows old
text under the new label. Same webkit version on Ubuntu 26.04 / NixOS 2.50.6 doesn't show
this, so it's some webkit × GTK/mutter/mesa interaction we can't auto-detect yet.

If you hit it, open **Settings > Advanced > Arch** and flip one of:

- **Disable GPU compositing** — keeps blur, fixes the ghost via the same API path VMs already
  use. Requires restart.
- **Disable blur effect** — drops `backdrop-filter`, keeps tint. Live; no restart.

If neither helps, please open an issue with: `pacman -Q webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 mutter mesa`,
`lspci -nn | grep VGA`, and `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.
