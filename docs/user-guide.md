# look User Guide

`look` is a keyboard-first launcher for macOS, Windows, and Linux focused on fast local actions.

> **Cross-platform shortcut note.** Examples are written with macOS modifiers (`Cmd+...`). On Windows and Linux, read `Cmd` as `Ctrl` - except the launcher toggle, which is `Alt+Space` (since `Win+Space` / `Super+Space` are reserved by the OS or desktop environment).

## First run

Install with Homebrew (see [README](../README.md#install) for alternatives):

```bash
brew install --cask look
```

On first launch, Look will index your apps, files, and folders in the background. You can start using it immediately - results appear as indexing completes.

To bind `Cmd+Space` to Look, disable Spotlight's default shortcut: `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Spotlight`. To keep Spotlight, set `launcher_hotkey` in `~/.look/config` to another shortcut (for example `launcher_hotkey=ctrl+space`) and reload with `Cmd+Shift+;`.

## Permissions

Look is designed to need as few macOS permissions as possible:

- **No Accessibility permission** is required.
- **No Full Disk Access** is required. Look indexes standard user directories (`~`, `/Applications`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, etc.). To index a directory outside those defaults, add it via `file_scan_extra_roots` in `~/.look/config`.
- **No Screen Recording** is required.
- **Network access** is used for explicit actions - `t"` translation, `tw"` dictionary lookup, and `Cmd+Enter` web search - and, when **AI features** are enabled (macOS, on by default), for live Google search suggestions and the DuckDuckGo/Wikipedia answer card as you type. The AI model runs wherever you point it. Apple Intelligence is on-device and Ollama defaults to `localhost`, so by default no prompt leaves the machine. If you change `ollama_host` to a non-loopback address, or select a cloud-routed Ollama model (a `-cloud` tag, which the local daemon proxies to Ollama's service), then **your prompt travels over the network to that provider**. Separately from the prompt, your calendar, clipboard, and remembered facts are attached only when inference is on this machine; for anything remote they are withheld until you turn on `ai_allow_remote_context` in Settings. Turn the AI/web features off by setting `ai_enabled = false` in `~/.look/config` (or via Settings). Local search and indexing never make network calls.
- **Finder Automation** is requested only when you empty the Trash (`Cmd+D` on the pinned Trash folder). The Trash is protected by macOS, so Look asks Finder to empty it; macOS prompts once, and you can manage it under `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation`. Moving individual files to the Trash needs no permission.

**Settings > AI > Permissions** lists every capability that needs OS access (Calendar, Reminders), what Look does with it, and whether it's connected. **Grant all** asks for the outstanding ones in turn; macOS has no single "allow everything" prompt, so each still appears on its own. Once a permission has been answered - granted or denied - only System Settings can change it, so those rows link straight to the right pane. Look also asks the first time you use a feature that needs access, which is why `join` may prompt for Calendar.

If macOS prompts for permission during an action you didn't trigger, that's a bug - please [file an issue](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues).

## Core workflow

In the main input, type to search and press `Enter` to open.

Default search sources:

- installed apps
- local files/folders (from configured roots)
- curated System Settings entries
- anything you declared yourself (see [Your own sources](#your-own-sources))

Useful actions:

- `Cmd+E`: edit the selected file or folder in your editor (see [Preferred tools](#preferred-tools))
- `Cmd+T`: open a terminal at the selected folder, or at a file's parent
- `Cmd+K`: open the action menu for the selected row, listing every verb it accepts
- `Cmd+F`: reveal selected app/file/folder in Finder, or in the `file_manager` you declared
- `Cmd+C`: copy selected file/folder
- `Cmd+P`: toggle pick on the selected file/folder (multi-select); the picked set is written to the system pasteboard so you can paste them anywhere in Finder
- `Cmd+Shift+P`: clear all picked items
- `Cmd+D`: move the selected file/folder - or all picked items - to the Trash (macOS only for now). Like Finder's `Cmd+Delete`, this is immediate and unconfirmed because it's recoverable: the items go to the Trash, not permanent deletion. The rows disappear from results right away.
- `Cmd+Enter`: web search current query (Google)

When at least one item is picked, the right panel switches to the **Picked** list - each row has an `X` to remove a single item, plus a **Clear all** button. File/folder copies (both `Cmd+C` and `Cmd+P`) are excluded from clipboard history.

**Trash.** Type `trash` to pin the Trash quick folder; `Enter` opens it in Finder. With the Trash folder selected, its preview shows the item count and `Cmd+D` **empties** the Trash. Emptying is permanent, so it asks you to confirm (`Y`/`Enter` to empty, `N`/`Esc` to cancel). Look empties the Trash through Finder, so the first time you do this macOS asks for permission to control Finder (see [Permissions](#permissions)).

## Preferred tools

Name the editor, terminal, and file manager Look should hand a row to, and `Cmd+E` / `Cmd+T` / `Cmd+F` act through them. Four optional keys in `~/.look/config`:

```ini
text_editor=nvim
code_editor=zed
terminal=ghostty
file_manager=nautilus
```

| Key            | Used for                                            | Example values                                            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text_editor`  | editing one file (`Cmd+E` on a file row)            | `nvim`, `hx`, `micro`, `vim`, `zed`                       |
| `code_editor`  | opening a project folder (`Cmd+E` on a folder row)  | `zed`, `code`, `cursor`, `xcode`                          |
| `terminal`     | `Cmd+T`, and the host for any terminal editor       | `ghostty`, `iterm`, `kitty`, `wezterm`, `gnome-terminal`   |
| `file_manager` | the `Cmd+F` reveal target                           | `nautilus`, `dolphin`, `thunar`, `finder`                 |

**Declare nothing and nothing changes.** An undeclared key means the system default, which is what Look did before these keys existed. They are config-file only, with no Settings control, so edit `~/.look/config` and reload with `Cmd+Shift+;`.

**Name the tool, not a command.** A value is a tool *name*, never a command carrying its own arguments: `text_editor=nvim -u NONE` will not work. Look already knows how to drive each tool, including running a terminal editor inside your terminal, which is the whole reason you name one instead of writing a command. Case, a trailing `.app`, and a leading directory are forgiven, so `Zed`, `Zed.app`, and `/opt/homebrew/bin/zed` all mean `zed`. Spelling out a full path pins that exact build instead of whatever `PATH` finds first.

Which key an action uses:

- **Edit** takes `text_editor` on a file row and `code_editor` on a folder row: a file is a thing to edit, a folder is a project to open. Declaring only one of the two covers both.
- **Open terminal here** on a folder opens that folder; on a file it opens the file's parent, because "here" never means the file.
- **An app row gets neither.** Both actions are about a place you work in, and the folder holding an app is `/Applications`. Reveal still works on an app.
- A [source block](#your-own-sources) declaring its own `open` / `edit` / `terminal` / `reveal` beats these keys, for that block's rows only.
- `file_manager` opens the **containing folder**. Leave it undeclared if you want the file itself selected on arrival: only the platform's own manager can do that.

**Terminal editors.** Naming a terminal editor (`nvim`, `helix`, `kakoune`, `micro`, `nano`) as `text_editor` needs `terminal` declared too. Look then opens the terminal and runs the editor inside it, at the right path, so `terminal=ghostty` plus `text_editor=nvim` gives you all three of edit-a-file, edit-a-folder, and terminal-here from two words of config.

A value that cannot work says so instead of doing nothing:

| What you set                     | What Look tells you                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a terminal editor, no `terminal` | _nvim runs in a terminal; set terminal in your Look config_        |
| a terminal as `text_editor`      | _ghostty is a terminal; set text_editor to the editor it should run_ |
| `terminal=warp`, `terminal=hyper` | _warp cannot be told to run a command_                             |
| nothing at all                   | _Set text_editor in your Look config_                              |

Warp and Hyper are named because neither offers a way to run a command in a new window. Every other terminal is either known or driven with the `-e` convention, and one nobody has listed simply works if it honors `-e`.

**The action menu.** `Cmd+K` (or `Cmd+J`) on a file, folder, or app row lists every verb that row accepts, with the chord beside it and the declared tool's name filled in: *Edit in Zed*, *Open in Ghostty*, *Reveal in Finder*. `Cmd+J` / `Cmd+K` or the arrows move, `Enter` runs, `Esc` closes. On a row from a source block that declares `then` targets, the menu lists those targets instead, and the chords above keep working on the row.

## Super actions

With an empty query, the home screen shows a strip of system controls instead of results. Fire a tile by clicking it, or with `Cmd`+letter (macOS) / `Alt`+letter (Linux, Windows), where the letter is the one highlighted on the tile:

| Key | Tile        | Effect                       |
| --- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `B` | Bluetooth   | Toggle on/off                |
| `W` | Wi-Fi       | Toggle on/off                |
| `T` | Theme       | Switch dark/light            |
| `K` | Keep Awake  | Toggle sleep prevention      |
| `S` | Screensaver | Start it                     |
| `M` | Mic         | Mute/unmute                  |
| `P` | Now Playing | Play/pause the current track |
| `R` | Restart     | Restart (press twice)        |
| `D` | Shut Down   | Shut down (press twice)      |

Restart and Shut Down arm on the first press and only run on the second, so a stray key can't power the machine off. `Esc` or waiting a moment cancels the armed tile.

The rest of the strip is read-only: **Battery**, **Weather**, and the large slot on the left, which shows a running Pomodoro session, otherwise today's remaining todos, otherwise the clock.

Turn the strip off in `Settings > Appearance > Super Actions`. Off hides it and disables the letter shortcuts. Saved as `super_actions_enabled=true|false` in `~/.look/config`.

### Rearranging the strip

The arrangement is yours, in `~/.look/super-actions.toml`. Look writes it on first run with the layout above, so the file is its own reference - open it and the format explains itself.

Ready-made tiles to paste in: [lookbook's `tiles/`](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/lookbook/tree/main/tiles), which is also the place to share one you wrote.

It is a drawing of the screen. Each line is a row, each name is one cell:

```toml
layout = [
    "lslot       lslot       bluetooth   wifi        battery     weather",
    "lslot       lslot       theme       keepawake   screensaver weather",
    "mic         restart     shutdown    nowplaying  nowplaying  nowplaying",
]
```

Four edits, one mechanism:

- **Hide** a tile by deleting its name. Nothing closes up behind it - you get a gap where it was, because you removed it.
- **Move** one by putting its name somewhere else.
- **Resize** one by repeating its name across more cells. `weather` above stands two rows tall because it appears in both. A tile's cells must form a rectangle.
- **Leave a gap** on purpose with `.`.

Three tiles need room to say anything, so they have a floor, in columns x rows: the big left slot 2x2, `weather` 1x2, `nowplaying` 2x1. Every other tile fits in one cell. Drawn smaller, a tile would be clipped rather than shrunk, so Look leaves it out and says which one. The seeded file lists each minimum beside its key.

There is no column or row count to declare: the drawing is the count. Every row needs the same number of names, and there is a ceiling of five rows and six columns.

The names are the tile ids - `lslot`, `bluetooth`, `wifi`, `battery`, `theme`, `keepawake`, `screensaver`, `weather`, `mic`, `restart`, `shutdown`, `nowplaying` - and the seeded file lists them with what each one does.

`Cmd+Shift+;` reloads the file, so you can arrange the strip while looking at it. **Delete the file to go back to the default.**

If the drawing is wrong, Look says so in the window rather than failing quietly. A problem with one tile drops that tile and keeps the rest; a problem with the file's structure - a row with the wrong number of names, or TOML it cannot read - falls back to the whole default layout, so the strip is never empty and never silent about why.

### Tiles of your own

A tile of your own is a name in the drawing plus an entry below it. Nothing changes in `~/.look/sources/` - a tile is declared whole, in this one file, and needs no source at all.

```toml
layout = [
    "lslot   lslot   disk    weather",
    "lslot   lslot   lock    weather",
]

[tiles.disk]
value   = '''printf '{"value":"%s","caption":"DISK FREE","icon":"internaldrive","lines":["of %s"]}' "$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $4}')" "$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $2}')"'''
refresh = "5m"

# A tile that only ACTS. No `value`, so nothing runs until you press it and
# there is nothing to display - it draws like Mic and Screensaver do.
#
# `pmset displaysleepnow` sleeps the display, which locks the Mac when
# System Settings > Lock Screen is set to ask for a password after sleep.

[tiles.lock]
press    = "pmset displaysleepnow"
title    = "Lock"
confirm  = "Lock the screen?"
icon     = "lock.fill"
mnemonic = "L"   # Cmd+L (Alt+L elsewhere), and the L in "Lock" is highlighted
```

**`value` prints one JSON object.** Only `value` is required, so a shell one-liner is a whole tile:

```json
{"value": "84Gi"}
```

A tile drawn bigger than one cell can say as much as Weather does:

```json
{"value":   "84Gi",
 "caption": "DISK FREE",
 "lines":   ["of 460Gi"],
 "icon":    "internaldrive",
 "state":   "off"}
```

Printing nothing hides the tile - that is how a "next meeting" tile disappears on a day with no meetings.

**`icon` names the symbol drawn on the tile.** A tile that only acts runs no command, so there is no JSON for an icon to arrive in and this key is its only way to be anything but the generic mark. A tile with a `value` can use either, and an icon in the printed JSON wins, since that one can change with what was read.

On macOS the name is an SF Symbol, so anything in that set works (`lock.fill`, `internaldrive`, `calendar`).

On Linux the name is either one of the strip's own glyphs - `bluetooth`, `wifi`, `theme`, `keepawake`, `battery`, `screensaver`, `mic`, `restart`, `shutdown` - or a path to an image of your own:

```toml
icon = "~/.look/icons/nixos.svg"
```

The file is read when the strip resolves its layout and drawn as a mask, so it takes the tile's colour like every other glyph rather than arriving in its own, and follows the active tint when a reading says `"state": "on"`. SVG, PNG, and the other formats an icon theme uses all work, up to 256 KB. Because it is a mask, only the shape survives: a flat silhouette reads at 16px, a detailed illustration collapses into a blob. Windows draws from the built-in names only.

An unrecognised name draws nothing at all rather than a placeholder, so a tile with a typo in its `icon` looks like a tile that asked for none.

**`press` is what a click or the tile's key runs.** A tile with `press` and no `value` is a button: it shows its name and never runs anything until you press it. A tile with `value` and no `press` is a readout. `confirm` arms the tile on the first press and fires on the second, the way Restart and Shut Down do.

**Keep the command light.** `value` runs unattended - the point of a live tile - so it is capped: **two seconds**, then it is killed along with anything it started, and 16 KB of output. Within a tile's `refresh` window nothing runs at all, so most opens cost nothing. Read something and print it; a slow command will be cut off and the tile keeps its last good reading. Anything that needs to fetch, build, or wait belongs behind `press`, or in a script that caches to a file the tile just reads.

A tile that fails says so and keeps what it last showed - one broken tile never blanks the strip. Its key follows the same rules as the built-ins: it fires with `Cmd` on macOS and `Alt` on Linux/Windows, a letter already used by a tile on the screen is not given away, `Cmd+Q` belongs to quitting Look, and either way the tile still works, it just has no key.

## AI answers and web suggestions (macOS, Linux, Windows)

Look can answer questions and look things up without leaving the launcher. These features are **on by default** on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Toggle them in Settings or with `ai_enabled` in `~/.look/config`.

- **Answer card.** A question, an entity that has no local match (e.g. `sir alex ferguson`), or an instant-answer pattern (weather, currency, crypto) shows a Spotlight-style card above the results. Sources resolve independently and each appears as it lands - **DuckDuckGo** and **Wikipedia**. Arithmetic doesn't answer here anymore - see the **Calculator row** under Query prefixes below. On macOS, when no web source has an answer it falls back to a streaming on-device **Apple Intelligence** answer. Click a source label to open it; the copy button copies that block.
- **Search suggestions.** For plain text queries (2+ characters), Google autocomplete rows appear under the results. `Enter` on a suggestion (or `Cmd+Enter` on your query) runs a web search in your default browser.
- **Query rewrite** _(macOS only)_. When a natural-language query finds nothing locally, the on-device model rewrites it into Look's prefix grammar and searches again. It never overrides results you can already see - it only runs when the raw query came up empty.

**Platform note.** The web answer card and Google suggestions are available on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The on-device LLM - query rewrite and the Apple Intelligence answer fallback - is **macOS-only**; there is no on-device model on Linux/Windows, so there the card uses web sources (DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, currency/weather/crypto) only. The `ai_enabled` toggle is shared across platforms.

**Network note.** While AI features are on, the answer card's web sources and the Google suggestions send your typed query to those services (DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Google). The on-device model makes no network calls of its own. Set `ai_enabled = false` to disable all of it and run fully offline.

## Query prefixes

Don't remember the prefixes? Type a single `"` to open a menu listing every prefix with a short description - pick one (click or `↑`/`↓` then `Enter`) to drop it into the search field, ready for your term.

- `a"term` -> apps only
- `f"term` -> files only
- `d"term` -> folders only
- `rc"term` -> recent files/folders, newest activity first (optional filter; `rc"` alone lists all). Blends what you've opened through Look with what recently appeared/changed on disk (downloads, screenshots). macOS for now.
- `r"pattern` -> regex search (case-insensitive)
- `ps"term` -> running processes; `Enter` measures that process's CPU, `Cmd+D` (`Ctrl+D`) kills it, `Cmd+C` (`Ctrl+C`) copies its PID
- `c"term` -> clipboard history search
- `ci"term` -> copied images, newest first
- `t"text` -> quick translation panel
- `tw"text` -> dictionary lookup panel

Path-like queries (for example `git/project/readme`) are also supported and bias path matches.

URL-like queries are detected automatically (no prefix). Type a URL and Look offers an **Open in browser** row: a structural URL (with a scheme, port, path, or `localhost`/IP - e.g. `http://localhost:3000` or `example.com/docs`) ranks at the top, while a bare `host.tld` (e.g. `github.com`) ranks after your local results so it never displaces a real match. URLs you open this way come back as **Recently opened** rows, ranked by frecency and filtered as you type.

Arithmetic is detected automatically too (no prefix). Type an expression like `2+2` or `sqrt(16)` and Look pins a **Calculator** row above every other result with the answer. `Enter` or a click copies the value and hides the launcher; clipboard history (`c"`) shows the worked expression (`2+2 = 4`) but still pastes just the value. Shape decides whether something counts as math, not spacing, so a date (`20-05-2026`), a resolution (`1920x1080`), or a ratio (`16:9`) is left alone. Aliases `x`, `:`, and a leading `v` (multiply, divide, square root) only count as operators when they stand alone (`3 x 4`, `10 : 2`, `v 16`) - inside the dedicated `/calc` panel below they're honored wherever they land, so `1920x1080` there evaluates as a product.

## Clipboard and translation

Clipboard mode (`c"`):

- stores recent text clips for the running app session (history size is configurable via `clipboard_history_limit`, see File-only settings below),
- `Enter` on a clipboard row copies that content back to clipboard,
- `Cmd+I` (`Ctrl+I` on Linux and Windows) pastes the selected row straight into the app you came from, text clips and image clips (`ci"`) alike. The clip stays on the clipboard afterwards, exactly as `Enter` leaves it. On macOS it needs Look enabled under System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility, and it cannot reach a secure input field (a password prompt, `sudo` in a terminal) - Look says so instead of pasting nothing. On Linux it types `Ctrl+Shift+V` when the app you came from is a terminal, since `Ctrl+V` there is the literal-next key; on a Wayland session that offers no way to type into another window, Look says so and leaves the clip copied for you to paste by hand (GNOME needs Look's shell extension, which it installs itself),
- `Cmd+D` (`Ctrl+D` on Linux/Windows) removes the selected row from Look's clipboard history.

Translation mode (`t"`/`tw"`):

- supports EN/VI/JA result sections,
- translation uses network requests.

## Command mode

Enter command mode with `Cmd+/`, or jump straight to a specific command from the home screen with the `:` prefix:

- `:calc` then `Enter` - open `/calc` with empty input
- `:calc 2+2` - opens `/calc` with `2+2` already typed (the space after the command id is the trigger; you can keep typing without pressing Enter)
- Same pattern for `:shell`, `:kill`, `:sys`, `:pomo`, `:todo`, `:speed`

The `:` prefix only triggers when the word right after it is a known command id (`calc`, `pomo`, `todo`, `speed`, `kill`, `shell`, `sys`); anything else (`:foo`, `:Users/me/...`) stays in normal search.

Built-in commands:

- `calc`: evaluate expressions (supports `^`, `!`, constants `pi`/`e`, functions `sqrt`/`abs`/`round`/`floor`/`ceil`, `%` shorthand, implicit multiplication like `2pi`, comma-grouped/scientific-notation input like `1,500` or `1e6`, and aliases `x`/`:`/leading `v` honored wherever they land, e.g. `1920x1080`)
- `shell`: run shell command text
- `kill`: force-kill a running app/process (with confirmation), supports port queries like `:3000` or `port 3000`
- `sys`: show system information
- `pomo`: pomodoro focus timer with editable session list, three timer styles (Modern Ring / Vintage Dial / Minimal Text), background-music folder, menu-bar mini-timer, and a 5-second standby fade
- `todo`: daily tasks and progress. Two pages - a task list grouped by day, and a Stats page (weekly/monthly completion, streak, 30-day trend, GitHub-style year heatmap)
- `speed`: measure the connection (download, upload, latency) on a live dial, with your LAN and public addresses

`calc` quick examples:

- `2^3` -> `8`
- `-2^2` -> `-4`
- `4!` -> `24`
- `2*pi` -> `6.2832`
- `200*15%` -> `30`
- `10%3` -> `1` (`%` remains modulo when used between operands)
- `1920x1080` -> `2,073,600` (`x` as an alias for multiply, honored even glued to digits inside `/calc`)
- `1,500 + 1` -> `1,501` (comma-grouped input round-trips)

`speed` quick reference:

- The test starts when the panel opens, unless the last reading is under a minute old. `R` runs a fresh one, `Escape` leaves
- A run takes about 15 seconds and deliberately saturates the link while it does. It can take longer when the primary server is refusing and a fallback mirror has to be found
- The dial reads as an instrument: download orbits the outer ring, upload counter-rotates on the inner one, and each comet's pace and tail length grow with its rate on a log scale (1 Mbps to 1 Gbps). The centre is latency, pulsing once per round trip
- Under the numbers is a plain-language read of them, e.g. `FAST BROADBAND · LATENCY EXCELLENT`
- `LAN` is this machine's address on your network; `WAN` is what the far end sees. WAN is masked by default - `E` or the eye button reveals it, and clicking either address copies it (the WAN copies in full even while masked)
- The footer names your ISP, rough location, and which server answered. `via Cloudflare` is the primary; anything else is a fallback mirror and reads conservatively low
- Latency is the round trip to the test server, timed as one TCP handshake against an already-resolved address, so it sits a little above what `ping` reports

`pomo` quick reference:

- Edit the **Session List** to plan focus + break blocks; the timer auto-advances through them and loops the music folder while running
- `Space` start/pause the active session • `R` reset • `P` toggle music play/pause
- Pick a folder of audio files (mp3/m4a/wav/aac/flac/ogg/aiff/alac); tracks are played one at a time, shuffled per launch
- A "session ending soon" alert fires 10s before each block ends - both as a menu-bar popover and (when granted) a macOS notification with chime
- Menu-bar mini-timer shows remaining time even when the launcher is hidden; click to jump back into `/pomo`

`todo` quick reference:

- Tasks are grouped by day, newest on top. Up to 3 unfinished tasks per day (complete one to add more) and up to 3 upcoming date groups (`Add date + N`)
- Past days are non-editable. Unfinished tasks 1-3 days late show an `EXTENDED` badge and can still be marked done; unfinished tasks more than 3 days late show `OVERDUE` and their completion state is locked
- Search matches task names and dates (`jul 3`, `yesterday`); case- and diacritic-insensitive
- Nothing autosaves: hit `Save` or `Cmd+S`; `Cmd+N` flips between the Tasks and Stats pages
- Press `Cmd+Z` (`Ctrl+Z` on Linux/Windows) to undo task changes, including deleting one task or clearing a day. The last 50 changes are kept, saved or not: undoing back past a Save marks the panel unsaved again, so a second Save writes the reverted list. Text fields keep their typing undo.
- Press `Cmd+Shift+Z` (`Ctrl+Shift+Z` on Linux/Windows) to redo an undone task change. Making a new edit clears the redo history; text fields keep their typing redo.
- When today has tasks, the home-screen hint bar shows a clickable `Todo X/Y` stat; hovering it lists what's still unfinished
- Data lives in the local database and is kept for one year

Behavior:

- `Escape`: leave command mode
- `Shift+Escape`: hide launcher
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`: switch commands while staying in command mode
- `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+7`: jump to specific command (`calc`, `pomo`, `todo`, `speed`, `kill`, `shell`, `sys`)
- `Cmd+N` / `Cmd+S` (inside `/todo`): switch Tasks/Stats page, save changes
- `R` / `E` (inside `/speed`): run the test again, show or hide the public address
- `Up` / `Down`: in `kill`, navigate process/app results
- shell text containing `sudo` shows an orange warning cue

## Launch modes (command line)

Look can open straight into a mode instead of the empty home screen, so a key you bind in your desktop or window manager becomes "open my clipboard history" rather than just "open Look".

```bash
lookapp clipboard          # opens with c" in the field
lookapp todo               # opens the todo panel
lookapp calc 2+2           # opens /calc with 2+2 typed
lookapp files report       # files-only search for "report"
```

The mode name comes first, and everything after it is the term, verbatim: `lookapp shell ls -la` keeps its `-la` instead of reading it as an option. Names are case-insensitive and most have shorter aliases.

| Mode | Aliases | Opens | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clipboard` | `clip`, `cb` | `c"` clipboard history | all |
| `clipboard-image` | `clipimg`, `ci` | `ci"` copied images | all |
| `apps` | `app` | `a"` applications only | all |
| `files` | `file` | `f"` files only | all |
| `folders` | `folder`, `dirs` | `d"` folders only | all |
| `recent` | | `rc"` recent files and folders | all |
| `regex` | `re` | `r"` regex search | all |
| `processes` | `ps` | `ps"` find and kill running processes | all |
| `translate` | `tr` | `t"` quick translation | all |
| `dictionary` | `dict` | `tw"` dictionary lookup | macOS |
| `calc` | `calculator` | the calculator panel | all |
| `pomo` | `pomodoro` | the pomodoro timer | all |
| `todo` | | daily tasks | all |
| `speed` | | the network speed test | all |
| `kill` | | running processes | all |
| `shell` | | the shell command panel | all |
| `sys` | | system info | all |
| `ai` | `chat`, `ask` | the `>` AI session | macOS |

Flags:

- `--toggle` shows or hides the running launcher. This is what you bind when `launcher_hotkey=none`
- `--mode <name> [term]` is the long form of a bare mode name, and `--query <text>` opens with exactly that text and no mode
- `--list-modes` prints the table as the build you are running sees it, so a macOS-only mode says so instead of disappearing
- `reload-config` re-reads `~/.look/config` in the running Look and exits without opening a window
- `--` ends the options, for a term that starts with a hyphen

A misspelled mode is an error and prints the list, since you were specific and missed. A mode this platform does not have says so rather than opening a search for `>`. Any other unrecognised argument opens Look normally, which is what keeps existing autostart lines working. `--mode` with no name prints the list instead of erroring, because a keybinding has no terminal to complain to.

## Your own sources

Look indexes apps, files, and System Settings by default. **Sources** are how you add your own rows: your repos, your SSH hosts, your morning routine, your deploy script. They rank, preview, and act like every other row.

> Needs Look v0.6.12 or newer.

Declare them in TOML files under `~/.look/sources/`. Put as many files in there as you like: Look reads **every** `.toml` in the directory and merges them, so you can split by topic (`work.toml`, `git.toml`, `ssh.toml`) and delete one when you are done with it. Block ids have to be unique across all of them.

Each `[block]` has a `name` you can type and exactly one producer key that says what it is:

| Producer | Rows it makes                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `do`     | one row; `Enter` performs its steps     |
| `dir`    | the children of one or more directories |
| `file`   | the lines of a text file                |
| `run`    | the lines a command prints              |

```toml
# ~/.look/sources/mine.toml

[projects]
name = "Projects"
dir  = "~/dev"
only = "dirs"
edit = "nvim {path}"

[work]
name = "Work setup"
do   = ["open -a Slack", "open -a Safari https://github.com"]
```

Reload with `Cmd+Shift+;` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+;` (Linux, Windows) and type `projects`.

From there you can add `then` targets (actions and drill-downs reached with `Cmd+K`), a `preview` command for the right panel, a `confirm` question before anything destructive, per-row icons via `format = "json"`, and `aliases` / `bias` to place a block in the ranking.

Commands are shell text, run by your login shell, so your own scripts are first-class: `run = "~/bin/my-repos"` or `do = ["~/bin/deploy.sh {path}"]`, in any language with a shebang, reading the row from `LOOK_ID` / `LOOK_TITLE` / `LOOK_PATH` if that suits it better than arguments. An executable dropped straight into `~/.look/sources/` needs no declaration at all: it _is_ a `run` block. One caveat worth knowing up front: a login shell reads `~/.zprofile` and `~/.zshenv`, not `~/.zshrc`, and fish/nu users fall back to `/bin/sh`.

## Settings and config

Open settings with `Cmd+Shift+,`.

### Appearance / Themes

The Appearance tab controls:

- **Tint Color** - accent color for UI highlights (RGB + opacity)
- **Blur** - blur material and opacity for the launcher window
- **Font** - name and size for launcher text
- **Font Color** - text color (RGB + opacity)
- **Border** - border thickness and color
- **Inner Gap** - gap between the top row, results list and preview, `0` to `24` in the platform's own unit (points on macOS, pixels on Linux and Windows). `0` is the classic framed panel; above 0 each becomes its own floating card. Both a fresh config and an absent key mean `7`. Saved as `inner_gap`
- **Corner Radius** - one multiplier on the resting corner rounding of every surface at once: the window, the top bar, the super-action tiles, the controls. Range `0` to `2.5`, default `1.5`; `0` is square. Saved as `ui_surface_radius`. One setting rather than one per surface, so they cannot disagree with each other

Built-in theme presets are available:

| Theme       | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Catppuccin  | Warm pastels (Mocha variant)      |
| Tokyo Night | Dark with vibrant accents         |
| Rose Pine   | Soft pink-tinted dark theme       |
| Gruvbox     | Retro warm tones                  |
| Dracula     | Classic purple-accented dark      |
| Kanagawa    | Japanese-inspired dark theme      |
| Kindle      | Paper and ink e-reader look       |
| Liquid      | Liquid Glass surface (macOS 26+)  |
| Custom      | Your own colors derived from tint |

Theme is saved as `ui_theme=<name>` in config, and a name written there overrides
the individual `ui_*` values. Save Config writes the preset name only while every
value still matches that preset; once you tweak one, it writes `ui_theme=` and
your literal `ui_*` values instead, so the edit survives a reload. Kindle is the
one light preset: it also switches the frosted panels to a light material and the
font to Charter, macOS' stand-in for Bookerly. Picking a preset overwrites your
tint, text color, border and font; `Custom` keeps the current values and derives
the rest from them.

Liquid is the one preset that changes how surfaces are drawn rather than only
what colour they are. It renders the window and every tile on macOS 26's Liquid
Glass, rounds corners further, and uses far more transparent fills so the glass
reads as a lens rather than a panel. It needs macOS 26 and is hidden from the
picker on older releases. If a config written on macOS 26 is opened on an older
one, the value is kept and shown as unsupported rather than silently changed.
Two consequences worth knowing:

- `Blur Opacity` is disabled while Liquid Glass is the blur style, because glass
  has no blur to thin. Your value is kept and returns when you switch back.
- The glass follows `Blur Style`, not the theme name, so you can pick
  `Settings > Appearance > Blur Style > Liquid Glass` on any theme to get the
  glass surface with that theme's palette. Going the other way, selecting Liquid
  and then a different blur style keeps Liquid's palette _and_ its rounder
  corners, and swaps only the material for the classic blur.

On Linux and Windows, Liquid is clear glass rather than frosted: the same
palette, the same rounder corners, plus a bright rim along the top edge.
Refraction is not available to a web frontend at all - CSS can only blur what
the page itself drew, and the desktop behind the window is drawn by the system,
not the page.

Blur behind the window is the compositor's to grant, and Look asks for it
wherever the ask exists: KDE Plasma 6.7+, Hyprland 0.56+ and Niri through the
`ext-background-effect-v1` protocol, older Plasma through KDE's own, and KWin on
X11 through a window property. There is nothing to switch on - if your
compositor takes the request the frost is there, and `Blur Opacity` starts
thinning the tint so more of it shows through. Everywhere else (GNOME today,
plain sway, X11 without KWin) Look stays clear glass and `Blur Opacity` applies
only when you have set a background image. Driving blur from your own compositor
config still works; Look's request is additional, not exclusive.

**Running Apps**: a switch that shows running-app icons in the right half of the search bar. When on, the search field shrinks to the left half and the running apps fill the right half (right-aligned, growing leftward as more apps open). Each icon has a corner number badge; pressing the modifier + the badge digit on the home screen activates that app - `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+9` on macOS, `Alt+1`..`Alt+9` on Linux and Windows. When off, the search bar spans the full width and the switcher shortcut is disabled. AI mode (`>`) hides the row regardless of this setting, and its digits open listed conversations instead. The launcher window stays the same size either way.

Behavior:

- **Stable** - icons sit in alphabetical order and don't shuffle when you switch apps. The activation digit for a given app stays the same until you launch or quit something.
- **Ergonomic badge keys** - easier-to-reach keys are assigned first. With 5 running apps the badges are `1, 2, 3, 8, 9` (skipping the harder middle keys); `5/6/7` only get used when you have 7+ apps running.
- **Linux focus** - Look's GNOME Shell extension activates the app's most-recent window on Wayland; X11 uses `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` via x11rb; sway/Hyprland use `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management`; i3 uses `i3-msg`; niri uses its own IPC socket, which also scrolls the view to the window's workspace.
- **Windowless apps** (Finder with no Finder windows, etc.) get a fresh window via a Dock-style "reopen" so you don't see an empty flash.

Saved as `running_apps_placement=<value>` in `~/.look/config` (`none` = off, any other value = on; legacy `top`/`right`/`bottom` values still load as "on"). New keys are auto-appended to existing config files on next Save Config.

**Super Actions**: a switch that shows the control strip on the empty home screen. Off hides it and disables its letter shortcuts. See [Super actions](#super-actions). Saved as `super_actions_enabled=true|false`. Which tiles are on the strip, and where, is not a setting - it is the drawing in `~/.look/super-actions.toml`; see [Rearranging the strip](#rearranging-the-strip).

### Indexing Settings

Default values:

- **File Scan Depth**: 4 (range: 1-12)
- **File Scan Limit**: 4000 (range: 500-50000)
- **Lazy indexing**: On

Advanced controls:

- **Extra Scan Dirs**: add user-specific directories to index on top of default roots
- overlap and risky-root validation is enforced for extra scan dirs

These control how deeply and how many files are indexed for search.

Lazy indexing behavior:

- when **On**, Look listens for file/app create/remove/rename events and marks the index dirty,
- pressing `Cmd+Space` triggers background reindex only when dirty,
- when **Off**, pressing `Cmd+Space` always triggers background reindex.

### Other Settings

- settings-only blur multiplier (`Settings Blur`) for readability when settings is open
- translation privacy and backend log level
- launch at login

Runtime config file:

- path: `~/.look/config`
- optional override: `LOOK_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config`
- reload after manual edits: `Cmd+Shift+;`
- reload from a script: `lookapp reload-config` applies the file in the running Look without opening the window, so a script that rewrites the theme (for example to follow the wallpaper) takes effect immediately. If Look is not running it does nothing and exits 0.
- reset to fresh defaults from UI: `Settings -> Advanced -> Create Fresh Config` (confirmation popup)

NixOS / Home Manager users can manage the same file declaratively through the
flake's Home Manager module. Add the input and pass `inputs` down to your
modules, which Home Manager does not do on its own:

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs.look.url = "github:kunkka19xx/look?dir=apps/linows";

homeConfigurations."me" = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
  inherit pkgs;
  extraSpecialArgs = { inherit inputs; };   # or home-manager.extraSpecialArgs
  modules = [ ./home.nix ];
};
```

```nix
# home.nix
{ inputs, ... }: {
  imports = [ inputs.look.homeModules.default ];

  programs.lookapp = {
    enable = true;
    theme = "kindle";
    settings.ai_enabled = false;
    # package = null;  # config only, Look already installed system-wide
  };
}
```

Activation merges those keys into `~/.look/config` instead of replacing it, so
settings you change in the app are kept and only the keys declared in Nix are
overwritten. Removing a key from the Nix config removes it from the file on the
next rebuild. Nix wins on every activation, so for the keys it manages, edit the
Nix config and rebuild rather than using Look's in-app Save Config button. The
first activation copies the pre-Nix file to `~/.look.config.hm-backup`. See
`apps/linows/BUILDING.md` for the full option list.

Backend-related keys:

- `app_scan_roots`, `app_scan_depth`, `app_exclude_paths`, `app_exclude_names`
- `file_scan_roots`, `file_scan_extra_roots`, `file_scan_depth`, `file_scan_limit`, `file_exclude_paths`
- `ignored_patterns_<group>` (path-aware file ignore globs, merged across all groups)
- `lazy_indexing_enabled`
- `skip_dir_names`
- `alias_<keyword>` (for app + System Settings query aliases, for example `alias_note=Notion|Obsidian|Notes|Apple Notes|Bear|Logseq`)
- `backend_log_level`, `launch_at_login`, `add_to_path` (Windows)

File-only settings (no Settings UI):

These keys have no control in the Settings screens. Edit `~/.look/config` directly, then reload with `Cmd+Shift+;` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+;` (Linux/Windows), or restart Look. Out-of-range or unparseable values fall back to the listed default. More keys will be added here over time.

- `clipboard_history_limit` (clipboard history size, range 10 to 100, default 10)
- `launcher_hotkey` (global shortcut that shows and hides Look; modifiers `cmd`/`win`, `ctrl`, `alt`/`option`, `shift` plus one key: a letter, digit, `space`, `enter`, `tab`, `esc`, `f1`-`f20`, or a symbol like `` ` ``. Examples: `ctrl+space`, `alt+shift+space`, `f13`. Default `cmd+space` on macOS, `alt+space` on Windows and Linux. `none` stops Look registering any key, so you can bind `lookapp --toggle` in your desktop or a tool like skhd/AutoHotkey instead; Linux accepts only `none` and applies it on restart. An invalid value falls back to the default and the reload banner says why)
- `query_retention_seconds` (how long the main query survives while Look is hidden, in seconds; the first open past it returns to the empty home screen; default 5, `0` clears on every hide, and any negative value keeps the query indefinitely)
- `text_editor`, `code_editor`, `terminal`, `file_manager` (the tools `Cmd+E` / `Cmd+T` / `Cmd+F` act through, see [Preferred tools](#preferred-tools); undeclared means the system default)

- `ignored_patterns_<group>` uses gitignore-style path glob syntax: `*`, `**`, `?`, `[abc]`
  - macOS/Linux normally use `/` paths like `~/Library/...` or `/home/name/...`
  - Windows is verified with native absolute paths like `C:\Users\me\...`; `~` is expanded against your home directory before matching
  - macOS works the same way; common roots are `~/Library/...`, `~/Documents/...`, `~/Downloads/...`
  - values are separated with `|`, and all `ignored_patterns_*` entries are merged together
  - patterns apply to files only; they do not exclude folders from traversal

  Examples:
  - `ignored_patterns_macos=~/Library/Application Support/Code/logs/**/*.log|~/Library/Caches/**/*.tmp`
  - `ignored_patterns_windows=C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Temp\**\*.etl|C:\Users\me\Downloads\**\*.tmp`
  - `ignored_patterns_browser=~/AppData/Local/BraveSoftware/**/*.log|~/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/**/*.tmp`
  - `ignored_patterns_sqlite=~/Documents/git/project/**/*.db-wal|~/Documents/git/project/**/*.db-shm`
  - `ignored_patterns_temp=~/Downloads/*.tmp|~/Downloads/**/*.part`

  Quick matching guide:
  - `*` matches within one path segment: `~/Downloads/*.tmp`
  - `**` matches across nested folders: `~/Downloads/**/*.tmp`
  - keep patterns path-scoped when possible; `*.log` works but is usually too broad

Alias note:

- aliases do not create synthetic results; they only boost existing indexed app/System Settings entries
- if an aliased app is not installed, there is no error and no result is added
- keep alias lists short (around 5-10 targets per keyword) to avoid noisy ranking

Default alias presets (fresh config files):

- `alias_note=Notion|Obsidian|Notes|Apple Notes|Bear|Logseq`
- `alias_code=Visual Studio Code|VSCode|Cursor|Windsurf|IntelliJ IDEA|PyCharm|WebStorm|Neovim|Xcode|Zed`
- `alias_term=Terminal|iTerm|iTerm2|Ghostty|WezTerm|Alacritty|Kitty|Warp`
- `alias_chat=Slack|Discord|Telegram|Messages`
- `alias_music=Spotify|Apple Music|Music`
- `alias_brow=Safari|Arc|Google Chrome|Chrome|Firefox|Brave`

Preset update behavior:

- presets are written automatically only when `~/.look/config` is created for the first time
- app updates do not rewrite an existing config file, so existing users should add new `alias_*` keys manually

Fresh config reset behavior:

- `Create Fresh Config` replaces the current config file with the latest default template
- reset uses the active config path (`LOOK_CONFIG_PATH` when set, otherwise `~/.look/config`)
- existing custom values are replaced during this reset flow (use manual edit + `Cmd+Shift+;` if you only want partial changes)

UI-related keys include the `ui_*` group (tint/blur/font/border values).

Note: `Settings Blur` is stored as local app UI state (UserDefaults) and is not written to `~/.look/config`.

## Keyboard shortcuts (quick reference)

- `Enter`: open selected result / run command
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`: next/previous result (app list) or command (command mode)
- `Up` / `Down`: move selection (and in `kill`, move process selection)
- `Cmd+/`: command mode
- `:cmd` (e.g. `:calc 2+2`, `:kill chrome`, `:sys`, `:todo`, `:speed`): jump to a command directly from the home screen
- `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+7`: in command mode, direct command switch (`calc`, `pomo`, `todo`, `speed`, `kill`, `shell`, `sys`)
- `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+9` (macOS) / `Alt+1`..`Alt+9` (Linux, Windows): on the home screen, activate the running-app whose badge shows that digit, when `Running Apps` is on. Badge labels are ergonomic, not strictly positional - see Settings → Appearance → Running Apps
- `Option+Up` / `Option+Down` in AI mode (`>`): walk your recent prompts, like a shell history. `Shift+Up` / `Shift+Down` select text in the message instead
- `Shift+Enter` in AI mode (`>`): new line in the message instead of sending. The box grows to 6 lines and stops there. Elsewhere `Shift+Enter` still opens all picked files
- `join` (or `join meeting`, `join my next meeting`, or `join <meeting name>`): pins a "Join <meeting>" row for the next Teams / Zoom / Meet / Webex / Jitsi / GoToMeeting / Whereby meeting in your calendar; Enter opens the link. Works in the main bar and in `>` AI mode. Looks two days ahead. Needs the account in macOS Calendar (System Settings → Internet Accounts), since Look reads the OS's calendar and makes no network call of its own
- `call <name>` / `facetime <name>` / `message <name>` in AI mode (`>`): finds the person in Contacts and opens FaceTime or Messages. `call mom on iphone` dials through your iPhone. A bare `call` means FaceTime audio, the one that works with no iPhone nearby. Look always lists what it found first; `Enter` on the highlighted row places the call
- `Cmd+D` in AI mode (`>`): delete the highlighted conversation (same as `Cmd+Delete`; undo from the banner with `Cmd+Z`)
- `Cmd+H` in AI mode (`>`): open the help screen on its **AI** topic without leaving the conversation. `Cmd+H`, `Esc`, or typing returns to it. The help screen's topic capsules (All / Main / AI / Prefixes / Command) also switch by click
- `Cmd+1`..`Cmd+9` and `Cmd+0` in AI mode (`>`): open the listed conversation carrying that chip (`Cmd+0` is the tenth). The running-apps row is hidden on the AI screen, so the digits mean sessions there, and `Cmd+0` opens the tenth session rather than resetting the UI scale while the list is up. The list stops at ten because a `Cmd` chord is a single keypress; older conversations are found by typing, then Tab/arrows and Enter
- `Cmd+<letter>` (macOS) / `Alt+<letter>` (Linux, Windows): on the empty home screen, fire the super action with that highlighted letter (`B` Bluetooth, `W` Wi-Fi, `T` Theme, `K` Keep Awake, `S` Screensaver, `M` Mic, `P` play/pause, `R` Restart, `D` Shut Down), when `Super Actions` is on. A letter belongs to its tile, so one you have taken off the strip does nothing
- `Space` / `R` / `P` (inside `/pomo`): start/pause session, reset, toggle music play/pause
- `Cmd+N` / `Cmd+S` (inside `/todo`): switch Tasks/Stats page, save changes
- `R` / `E` (inside `/speed`): run the test again, show or hide the public address
- `Escape`: back/close (context dependent)
- `Shift+Escape`: hide launcher
- `Cmd+Enter`: web search
- `Cmd+E`: edit the selected file or folder in your `text_editor` / `code_editor`
- `Cmd+T`: open your `terminal` at the selected folder, or at a file's parent
- `Cmd+K` / `Cmd+J`: open the action menu for the selected row
- `Cmd+F`: reveal in Finder, or in the `file_manager` you declared
- `Cmd+C`: copy selected file/folder
- `Cmd+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`: toggle pick / clear picked set
- `Cmd+I` (`Ctrl+I` on Linux, Windows): paste the selected clipboard history item into the app you came from
- `Cmd+D`: remove the selected clipboard history item; otherwise move selected file/folder (or picked items) to Trash, or empty the pinned Trash folder
- `Cmd+Shift+,`: toggle settings panel
- `Cmd+Shift+;` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+;` (Linux, Windows): reload config, re-read your declared sources, and re-read `~/.look/super-actions.toml` so the strip can be arranged while you look at it
- `Cmd+Shift+H`: hide the selected app from Look
- `Cmd+-`, `Cmd+=`, `Cmd+0`: temporary UI zoom out/in/reset

## Troubleshooting

**Results seem stale or a newly installed app is missing.**

- reload config with `Cmd+Shift+;`
- if lazy indexing is Off, Look reindexes on every launcher open; if On, it reindexes only when filesystem changes are detected
- check scan roots, depth, and limits in `~/.look/config`
- add user-specific directories via `file_scan_extra_roots`

**`Cmd+Space` does not open Look.**

- confirm Spotlight's `Cmd+Space` is disabled or rebound (`System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Spotlight`)
- relaunch Look (`open "/Applications/Look.app"`) after changing the Spotlight binding
- if you previously ran a dev/side-by-side build, make sure only one Look instance is running
- if you changed `launcher_hotkey` to a shortcut, use that shortcut instead of `Cmd+Space`
- if you set `launcher_hotkey=none`, use an external binding such as `lookapp --toggle`

**The launcher opens behind another window.**

- this is usually a focus-handoff timing issue; hide the launcher (`Escape`) and open it again
- if it reproduces consistently, please file an issue with your macOS version

**High CPU or slow first launch.**

- the initial index scan is a one-time cost on first run; subsequent launches use the cached SQLite index
- you can lower `file_scan_depth` and `file_scan_limit` in `~/.look/config` if you have very large user directories

**A config change was ignored.**

- Look reads `~/.look/config` at launch. After editing manually, reload with `Cmd+Shift+;` or restart Look.
- confirm you edited the active config path (`LOOK_CONFIG_PATH` overrides `~/.look/config` when set)

**Translation (`t"` / `tw"`) returns no results.**

- translation requires network; check connectivity and retry
- corporate proxies and VPNs can block the translation endpoint

**Linux only - ghost slider trails or overlapping popovers in Settings.**

- not one distro's problem: reported on Arch, Ubuntu and inside VMs, while identical webkit builds elsewhere are unaffected, so it is a stack interaction we can't auto-detect
- open **Settings > Advanced > Rendering** and flip one toggle:
  - **Disable GPU compositing** (`disable_gpu_compositing`) - keeps blur, fixes the ghost. Requires restart.
  - **Disable blur effect** (`disable_blur_effect`) - drops blur, keeps tint. Takes effect immediately.
- both default off, and both are Linux-only. Configs written before the rename use `arch_disable_gpu` / `arch_disable_blur`, which are still read

**I want to reset everything to defaults.**

- `Settings > Advanced > Create Fresh Config` rewrites `~/.look/config` from the latest defaults (with a confirmation prompt)

## Uninstall

Homebrew:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask look
```

Manual install:

```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Look.app"
```

Remove local state (optional - includes config, your declared sources, index, and usage history):

```bash
rm -rf "$HOME/.look"
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/look"
rm -f "$HOME/.look.config"   # only if a pre-0.6 config was left behind
```

Those are the default paths. If you moved anything with an environment override, remove it yourself as well: `LOOK_CONFIG_PATH` (the config file), `LOOK_SOURCES_DIR` (your declared sources), and `LOOK_ROWS_CACHE_DIR` (the rows a `run` block cached).
