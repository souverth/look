- [x] **Command list 2-column**: Make command list 2-column layout for better visibility
- [x] **Theme presets foundation** ([#54](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues/54)): built-in theme preset system with Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Rose Pine, Gruvbox, Dracula, Kanagawa; semantic colors auto-derive from main text in Custom mode; theme persisted to `ui_theme` config
- [x] **Add preset: Catppuccin** ([#54](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues/54))
- [x] **Add preset: Tokyo Night** ([#54](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues/54))
- [x] **Add preset: Rose Pine** ([#54](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues/54))
- [x] **Add preset: Gruvbox** ([#54](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues/54))
- [x] **Add preset: Dracula** ([#54](https://github.com/kunkka19xx/look/issues/54))

Internal spec: `specs/quicklook-file-preview.md` (maintainer-only, gitignored)
- [ ] **Pomodoro command** (`/pomo`): focus timer in command mode with start/pause/stop, completion notification, and active-session indicator. Internal spec: `specs/pomodoro.md` (maintainer-only, gitignored)
- [ ] **Browser bookmark + history suggestions**: index the user's default browser (Safari/Chrome/Arc/Brave/Edge/Firefox) and surface bookmarks + recent pages as ranked launcher results. Internal spec: `specs/browser-suggestions.md` (maintainer-only, gitignored)
- [ ] **Homebrew release**: Package app for homebrew installation
- [x] **Build script**: Create release build and curl installer script

## Evergreen: Search quality and performance (always-on)

- [ ] **Indexing improvement loop**: continually refine scan roots, excludes, and incremental refresh strategy
- [ ] **Matching improvement loop**: improve typo tolerance, tokenization, and relevance scoring for mixed app/file queries
- [ ] **Optimization loop**: keep reducing query latency, startup cost, and memory use as regular maintenance

## Weekly checklist: quality + performance

Run this checklist at least once per week (or before release cut):

- [ ] collect baseline metrics from the same sample dataset and keep results in a dated note (`docs/bench-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- [ ] measure query latency (`p50`, `p95`) for empty query, short query (2-4 chars), and long query (8+ chars)
- [ ] measure startup time (app launch -> first usable search result)
- [ ] compare index size and memory usage versus last baseline
- [ ] verify top-5 relevance for a fixed smoke query set (apps, files, folders, settings)
- [ ] review at least 3 recent user-reported misses and convert into matching/indexing improvements
- [ ] add/update at least one test for any ranking/matching/indexing behavior change

Suggested guardrails (adjust as project evolves):

- `query latency p50`: <= 30ms
- `query latency p95`: <= 80ms
- `startup to first result`: <= 700ms
- `peak memory (idle window)`: <= 220MB
- `relevance smoke pass rate`: >= 90% in top-5

Escalation rule:

- if any guardrail regresses by >10% week-over-week, open a focused perf/quality issue before merging unrelated polish work
