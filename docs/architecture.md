# Architecture Guide

This is the canonical architecture document for `look`.

It intentionally merges architecture explanation and diagrams into one place, so design decisions and Mermaid views stay in sync.

## 1) System overview and design intent

`look` is a keyboard-first launcher (shipping on macOS, Windows, and Linux) designed for low-latency local search. The architecture separates UI concerns from search/index/ranking concerns (Rust), joined through a small FFI/command boundary. The UI layer is platform-specific:

- **macOS:** Swift / AppKit / SwiftUI under `apps/macos/LauncherApp/` (Xcode project), talking to the Rust core via the C ABI (`bridge/ffi`).
- **Windows + Linux:** Tauri 2 shell with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend under `apps/linows/` (`lookapp`), talking to the Rust core via Tauri commands. The macOS SwiftUI app is the design source of truth.

Every shell talks to the same Rust core, so search, indexing, ranking, and storage behave identically across platforms.

Key design goals:

- low per-keystroke latency,
- predictable behavior as candidate volume grows,
- practical relevance via text quality + usage/recency,
- local-first storage and processing,
- narrow, stable bridge between frontend and backend.

## 2) Module boundaries and responsibilities

- `apps/macos/LauncherApp/look-app`: launcher window, keyboard input, global hotkey, action dispatch, clipboard/history mode, command mode, theme/settings UX.
- `Support/Launcher/`: launcher-specific services and utilities:
  - `LauncherSearchCoordinator`: debounce + async search lifecycle
  - `LauncherTranslationService`: translation lookup
  - `LauncherWindowCoordinator`: window/focus management
  - `EngineBridge`: search engine communication
  - `ClipboardHistoryStore`, `KeyboardSelectionMonitor`, `GlobalHotKeyManager`
- `Themes/`: builtin theme presets (Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Rose Pine, Gruvbox, Dracula, Kanagawa, Kindle, Liquid) and semantic color tokens
- `Support/UI/`: shared UI primitives - `Motion` (all animation constants and the reveal modifiers), `ToggleSwitch`, `HoverTooltip`, `HoverBubble`
- `bridge/ffi`: narrow C ABI surface for search, usage recording, config reload, translation, todo load/save, speed test, and error payloads.
- `core/answers`: platform-agnostic, network-backed "web answer" lookups shared by every shell (macOS via `bridge/ffi`, Windows/Linux via Tauri commands). Instant answers (currency/weather/crypto), search suggestions, knowledge sources, and translation. Best-effort and panic-free: every entry point returns "no answer" on failure, with cheap network-free pattern-gating (`has_match`) so callers can fire speculatively while typing. No async runtime - HTTP is a blocking `curl` subprocess.
- `core/ai`: the AI brain - one place for prompts, parsers, and precedence so they cannot drift as tiers are added. The routing ladder (`route.rs`), the planner prompt/aliases/mapping (`planner.rs`, `plan.rs`), tool resolution with the ambiguity gate, dates, previews, and undo recipes (`resolve.rs`), the `@` grammar (`explicit.rs`), the date/word lexicon and window grammar (`lexicon.rs`, `window.rs`), natural-language file recall (`files.rs`), clipboard text-ops, conversations and long-term memory (crash-safe JSON stores), markdown segmentation, and the streamed chat transport (`chat.rs`: a curl child plus a reader thread, polled by the shell - chosen because polling crosses a C ABI without an async runtime). Data-only across the boundary: JSON in, JSON out, no closures. **The AI surface is macOS-only and no linows AI is being built** (wanted on Linux/Windows? open an issue - but local inference needs hardware those machines may not have, and Linux has no unified system calendar); the crate is Rust so the logic is testable without a UI and prompts/parsers live in one place, not because a port is scheduled. See `docs/ai-architecture.md`.
- `core/sources`: user-declared source blocks. Parsing (`def.rs`), reading the sources directory (`load.rs`), turning a block into rows (`collect.rs`, `rows.rs`), performing steps through the user's login shell with shell-escaped placeholder substitution (`run.rs`), and the block-verb-before-preferred-tool rule (`tools.rs`). Parsing and collection are pure; process execution is the shell's seam, so a `run` block's command is spawned by the shell and its rows handed back through `core/engine`'s row cache. `example.toml` is the annotated format reference, asserted against the parser by a test. See `docs/user-sources.md`.
- `core/indexing`: candidate model and indexing helpers used by engine/storage flows.
- `core/matching`: exact/prefix/fuzzy matching primitives.
- `core/ranking`: ranking helpers (usage/recency-aware adjustments and score composition).
- `core/storage`: SQLite integration, schema/migrations, candidate/usage persistence.
- `core/todo`: shared store for the `/todo` command. Owns the `todo_tasks` table inside the app's existing `look.db` (full-set load/save, one-year retention). macOS reaches it via `bridge/ffi`, linows via its Tauri command layer. `examples/seed.rs` fills a dev database with demo history, including near-today extension-window cases for `/todo` UI testing.
- `core/netspeed`: the `/speed` measurement, shared by every shell. A latency probe (the best of several TCP handshakes against a pre-resolved address, rather than a subtraction of two of curl's cumulative timers, whose order is not portable across curl builds), download and upload phases (four parallel `curl` streams each), and the plain-language verdicts and display strings both shells print, so a reading reads identically everywhere. Cloudflare's keyless endpoints are the primary source; when they rate-limit a connection the download phase falls back to the nearest of several public test mirrors, ranked by a round-trip probe. No async runtime, and every phase is timeout-bounded. macOS reaches it via `bridge/ffi`, linows via its Tauri command layer.
- `core/engine`: query parsing, indexing orchestration, scoring, top-k retrieval, in-memory cache management.

## 3) Request path and query understanding

Search request path:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant LV as LauncherView
    participant EB as EngineBridge
    participant FFI as look_search_json_compact
    participant QE as QueryEngine

    U->>LV: Type query
    LV->>LV: Debounce and cancel stale task
    LV->>EB: search(query, limit)
    EB->>FFI: C ABI call
    FFI->>QE: with_engine(search)
    QE->>QE: parse -> match -> rank -> top-k
    QE-->>FFI: Vec LaunchResult
    FFI-->>EB: JSON payload
    EB-->>LV: [LauncherResult]
```

Query mode parsing in engine supports explicit prefixes:

- `a"` app-only,
- `f"` file-only,
- `d"` folder-only,
- `r"` regex mode,
- empty query browse mode.

Normalization uses Unicode decomposition and diacritic folding to improve matching consistency across accented input.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input[raw query] --> Parse[ParsedQuery from_input]
    Parse --> Prefix{prefix type}

    Prefix -->|empty query| Browse[default_browse_score]
    Prefix -->|regex mode| Regex[RegexBuilder title/path/subtitle match]
    Prefix -->|normal text| Text[Text search path]
```

## 4) Indexing and persistence lifecycle

The indexing flow is designed as a bounded pipeline:

- discover candidates from apps/files/settings,
- deduplicate by id,
- chunked upsert to SQLite,
- delete stale entries,
- prune usage history,
- refresh in-memory cache for fast queries.

Runtime refresh triggers:

- file-system watcher monitors configured app/file roots and marks in-memory `index_dirty` on create/remove/rename events,
- launcher open (`Cmd+Space`) requests background refresh through FFI,
- refresh execution mode depends on `lazy_indexing_enabled`:
  - `true`: run only when dirty,
  - `false`: run on every launcher open request.

Watcher policy (linows, see `apps/linows/src-tauri/src/state.rs`):

- **apps roots** (`/usr/share/applications`, `~/.local/share/applications`, `XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications`) - watched **recursively** (small directories, cheap),
- **file roots** (`~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`, `file_scan_extra_roots`) - watched **non-recursively** to bound inotify watch count on large trees; deep-tree changes reconciled on next launcher-open refresh,
- **noise filter** suppresses events whose every path is a synthetic file (vim `.swp`, browser `.crdownload`/`.part`, Office `~$lock`, OS droppings),
- **debounce** (2 s) coalesces bursts before firing a refresh,
- **cooldown** (10 s) caps watcher-triggered refresh rate at ≤ 6/min; explicit launcher-open refreshes bypass it,
- **scoped refresh** - `QueryEngine::bootstrap_sqlite_scoped(path, scope)` re-walks only the dirty source family (apps-only / files-only / all). Stale deletion is scoped to the same id prefixes so unrelated rows survive,
- **off-thread reindex** - the watcher loop spawns a worker thread to run the bootstrap, so subsequent events keep draining instead of queuing in the kernel buffer,
- **RAII slot guard** ensures a panic inside the worker still releases the in-progress flag.

Benchmarks for this path live in `tools/perf/` (see [tools/perf/WATCHER_PERF.md](../tools/perf/WATCHER_PERF.md)).

    DeleteStale --> UsagePrune[prune usage events by age and max rows]

    RefreshCache --> Ready[Search-ready in-memory engine]
```

Persistence model:

```mermaid

    CANDIDATES {
        text id PK
        text kind
        text title
        text subtitle
        text path
        integer use_count
        integer last_used_at_unix_s
        integer indexed_at_unix_s
    }

    USAGE_EVENTS {
        integer id PK
        text candidate_id FK
        text action
        integer used_at_unix_s
    }

    SETTINGS {
        text key PK
        text value
    }

    INDEX_STATE {
        text source PK
        integer last_indexed_at_unix_s
    }

    CANDIDATES ||--o{ USAGE_EVENTS : candidate_id
```

---

## 5) Ranking, actions, and feedback loop

Search ranking combines multiple signals:

- fuzzy title/subtitle matching,
- contains/token and path matching,
- usage/recency-aware score adjustments,
- kind bias and path depth penalties,
- bounded top-k selection and optional rerank.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Text[Text search path] --> Fuzzy[fuzzy_score_prepared title and subtitle]
    Text --> Contains[contains_match_score]
    Text --> Path[path_match_score when slash hint]

    Fuzzy --> Base[Choose max base score]
    Contains --> Base
    Path --> Base

    Base --> Rank[rank_score + kind_bias + penalties]
    Rank --> TopK[BinaryHeap top-k pool]
    TopK --> Rerank[quality rerank for top-N when query len >= 3]
    Rerank --> Final[sort and return limit]
```

Usage recording closes the loop by updating persistent and in-memory state after open actions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Swift UI
    participant EB as EngineBridge
    participant FFI as look_record_usage_json
    participant ST as SqliteStore
    participant QE as QueryEngine cache

    UI->>EB: recordUsage(candidateId, action)
    EB->>FFI: look_record_usage_json(id, action)
    FFI->>FFI: Validate candidate id prefix and action
    FFI->>ST: INSERT usage_events and UPDATE candidates
    FFI->>QE: record_usage_in_memory(candidateId, now)
    FFI-->>EB: JSON {ok,error}
    EB-->>UI: Optional BridgeError
```

## 6) UI behavior, operational notes, and performance targets

UI interaction modes:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> NormalSearch
    NormalSearch --> ClipboardMode: clipboard prefix
    NormalSearch --> TranslationMode: translation prefix
    NormalSearch --> CommandMode: Cmd+/

    CommandMode --> NormalSearch: Esc
    ClipboardMode --> NormalSearch: remove clipboard prefix
    TranslationMode --> NormalSearch: clear translation prefix

    state NormalSearch {
      [*] --> Results
      Results --> OpenTarget: Enter
      Results --> RevealFinder: Cmd+F
      Results --> WebSearch: Cmd+Enter
    }

    state CommandMode {
      [*] --> Calc
      Calc --> Pomo: select /pomo
      Pomo --> Todo: select /todo
      Todo --> Speed: select /speed
      Speed --> Kill: select /kill
      Kill --> Shell: select /shell
      Shell --> Sys: select /sys
    }
```

Behavioral notes:

- global hotkey `Cmd+Space` toggles launcher visibility,
- web search is explicit handoff (`Cmd+Enter`),
- clipboard history mode is shell-side and in-memory for current session,
- command mode supports `calc`, `pomo`, `todo`, `speed`, `kill`, `shell`, `sys` (⌘1-7 / Ctrl+1-7 follow catalog order),
- settings panel controls theme/index/runtime knobs and persists locally.

## 7) Theme System

The theme system uses semantic color tokens for consistent theming across all built-in themes:

### Color Hierarchy

- **Main text (`fontColor`)**: Primary text color, user-configurable via font RGB sliders
- **Secondary text (`secondaryTextColor`)**: Section headers, labels
- **Muted text (`mutedTextColor`)**: Hints, subtitles, less important text
- **Panel fill (`panelFillColor`)**: Input fields, panels
- **Control fill (`controlFillColor`)**: Buttons, controls
- **Divider (`dividerColor`)**: Borders, separators
- **Selection (`selectionFillColor`)**: Selected item highlight
- **Accent (`accentColor`)**: Links, interactive elements
- **Success/Warning/Danger**: Semantic state colors

### Text Color Derivation (Custom Mode)

In "Custom" mode, semantic text colors auto-derive from main text color:
- Secondary = 82% brightness of main text
- Muted = 64% brightness of main text

This ensures good contrast whether using light or dark themes.

### Built-in Themes

Available themes (selected via Settings > Appearance):
| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Catppuccin | Warm pastels (Mocha variant) |
| Tokyo Night | Dark with vibrant accents |
| Rose Pine | Soft pink-tinted dark theme |
| Gruvbox | Retro warm tones |
| Dracula | Classic purple-accented dark |
| Kanagawa | Japanese-inspired dark theme |
| Kindle | Paper and ink, e-reader light theme (Charter serif) |
| Liquid | Liquid Glass surface, translucent fills (macOS 26+) |
| Custom | Auto-derived semantic colors from tint |

Themes are defined in `Themes/` folder:
- `BuiltinThemeStyle`: Base style with all color tokens
- `BuiltinThemePreset`: Dropdown selection enum
- Individual theme files: `CatppuccinTheme.swift`, `TokyoNightTheme.swift`, etc.

A preset declares its `ThemeAppearance` (`.dark` or `.light`). It pins the
NSVisualEffectView appearance, so a preset frosts the same way whether macOS is
in Light or Dark mode, and it picks how the opaque command-mode surfaces and the
pane scrims are mixed: dark themes darken, light themes lighten. A preset may
also declare a `fontName`; presets that do not reset the font to the app default
when applied.

A preset also declares a `ThemeSurface` (`.classic` or `.liquid`), the second
non-token axis alongside `ThemeAppearance`: it selects how surfaces are drawn
rather than what colour they are, and scales every themed corner radius through
`ThemeStore.surfaceCornerRadius(_:)`. Any new border or `clipShape` on a themed
surface must go through that helper, or it desyncs from the fill behind it and
draws a stray line across the corners.

`ThemeStore.themeSurface()` resolves the axis from `blurMaterial` first and the
preset second. That is deliberate: `savedThemeName()` stops recording `ui_theme`
as soon as any value diverges from its preset (the load path applies the theme
*over* the individual `ui_*` keys, so a stale name would discard the user's
tweaks), while `ui_blur_material` persists on its own. Keying off the material
means a customised Liquid theme keeps its glass across a relaunch.

Liquid Glass itself is `Components/GlassEffectBackdrop.swift`, an
`NSGlassEffectView` wrapper. Not SwiftUI's `glassEffect`, which refracts only
what sits behind it inside its own view tree: the launcher window is
transparent, so that renders as nearly nothing. The view also draws nothing
without a `contentView`, and the theme tint is passed into its `tintColor`
rather than layered over it, since a colour wash on top cancels the refraction.

On linows the same presets live in `apps/linows/src/css/theme.css`, one
`:root[data-theme="…"]` block per preset, with `js/screens/settings.js`
mirroring the raw slider values in `THEME_PRESETS` (tint, text and border are
also written as inline custom properties, so both sides must agree). Appearance
is not a flag there: a light preset flips the `--lift` / `--shadow` RGB
triplets that stand chips off the backdrop and seat panes on it, and repaints
the semantic tokens the dark presets inherit from `:root`. Opacities are the
user's (`USER_CONTROLLED_KEYS`) except at one moment: picking a preset whose
surface *is* its transparency snaps tint/text/border opacity back to the preset
(`OPACITY_OWNING_THEMES`), because paper at a dark theme's transparency doesn't
read as paper and glass at a near-opaque one is a blue panel. The switch
persists those values, so restore paths stay dumb and the sliders are the
user's again from the next drag. Kindle's font stack stays in CSS and applies
while the Font field is left at `system-ui`; an explicit font still wins.

The surface axis ports as `data-surface="liquid"` on the document element,
beside `data-theme`, with `css/liquid.css` carrying it. It is stored under its
own config key (`ui_surface`) rather than derived from the theme name, for the
same reason macOS resolves it from `ui_blur_material` first: nudging any slider
drops `ui_theme` to `custom`, and the surface must not go with it. The radius
scale is one custom property (`--surface-radius-scale`) that every themed radius
multiplies through - `--corner-radius`, `--control-radius`, `--tile-radius`,
`--bar-radius` - so a radius that skips the scale is a rule that hardcodes a px
value, not a call site that forgot a helper.

The material itself does not port. `backdrop-filter` blurs what the web engine
composited behind the element, and the desktop behind a `transparent: true`
window is composited by the OS, outside the webview; refraction has no CSS
primitive at all. So linows renders Liquid as clear glass rather than frost:
high transparency, a specular rim drawn as an overlay pseudo-element (above the
tint and the background image, and a hairline whatever the user's border
thickness), and saturated accents. Nothing in it needs the compositor, so it
looks the same everywhere, and it mirrors macOS 26 shipping `Glass.clear`
beside `Glass.regular`.

Real frost is available where the compositor grants it, and only there.
`platform/linux/blur.rs` asks: on Wayland through `ext-background-effect-v1`
(the cross-desktop staging protocol - KWin 6.7+, Hyprland 0.56+, Niri) falling
back to `org_kde_kwin_blur`, which Plasma spoke until 6.7; on X11 through the
`_KDE_NET_WM_BLUR_BEHIND_REGION` property, which only KWin reads. The Wayland
bind (`blur_wayland.rs`) attaches to GTK's own `wl_surface`, taken off the
window handle rather than through GDK FFI, and runs on a private event queue so
its roundtrips do not eat the events GDK is waiting for.

The Wayland request does not currently reach a native Wayland session: the
`set_blur_region` command is gated on the X11 window id, which nothing caches
when the window is not an X11 one, so the frost there is CSS only. Lifting that
gate is not enough on its own, and the notes below are what a second attempt
needs. GTK destroys the `wl_surface` on hide and makes a new one on the next
show, so the effect object bound at startup goes inert and the next
`set_blur_region` is a fatal `surface_destroyed` error, not a no-op: the object
has to be re-attached per surface. The region is double-buffered state applied
on the next surface commit, so a settled UI never publishes it. And
`getBoundingClientRect` reports the *animated* box, so a region built during the
entrance cascade is a hard-edged rectangle of frost sitting where the tile is
not, over a part of the window that paints nothing.

Two things follow from that being a capability rather than a setting. The
region comes from the frontend (`js/blur.js`), because only it knows which
surfaces are painted: one rectangle for the classic panel, one per tile once
the panes float, so the gaps stay clear instead of frosting into a single slab.
Both backends take rectangles only, so a rounded surface is approximated by the
cross of its two inset rects. And no config key is added: `PlatformInfo`
carries `compositor_blur`, which is what lets `effectiveBlurOpacity()` treat a
blurring compositor the same way it treats a background image, so the existing
Blur Style and Blur Opacity controls act on real frost when there is any.

### Motion

Every animated surface reads its physics from `Support/UI/Motion.swift`, so the
feel is tuned in one place: `Spawn` (the launchpad cascade), `Selection` (the
gliding pill and the one-shot zoom), `Slide` (horizontal entrances), `Surface`
(the panel arriving), `Press`, `Value` (digit rolls) and `Caret`.

Entrances key off `appearanceRevealToken`, a counter `LauncherView` bumps on
every show. The window is only ordered out and back in, so `onAppear` fires once
per process and cannot drive them. The modifiers are `rootReveal` (whole panel),
`spawnReveal` (launchpad tiles, quick actions, the search bar), `slideReveal`
via `placeholderReveal` / `stripReveal`, plus `symbolEffect(.bounce, value:)` on
SF Symbols.

Three constraints that are easy to break:

- **Scope animations tightly.** An `.animation(_:value:)` high in the tree
  attaches to its whole subtree, so when it fires every result row animates at
  once. Per-row it is just as bad: it fires on each neighbour as the selection
  passes. Row-local one-shot state driven by `onChange(of: isSelected)` is what
  keeps a single row moving.
- **`ThemedBackdrop` opts out of ambient transactions.** Nav wraps its selection
  assignment in a global `withAnimation`, and re-compositing an
  `NSVisualEffectView` or `NSGlassEffectView` inside that transaction flickers
  the whole window on every keypress.
- **Do not resolve icons inside `body` uncached.** `NSWorkspace.icon(forFile:)`
  returns a fresh `NSImage` per call, which SwiftUI redraws; every icon in the
  list then flickers on each keypress. `Support/RowIconCache.swift` returns one
  instance per path. Process icons stay uncached, since pids are reused.

Panel arrival is a content-layer effect, not a window one: animating the window
would mean touching the `makeKeyAndOrderFront` path that the Cmd+Space
cold-login bug lives in. Reduce Motion is honoured by every modifier.

On linows the same pass lives in `src/css/motion.css`: one `:root` block of
tokens (durations, offsets, stagger, the house curve) and the keyframes that
read them, driven by classes rather than a token counter. `js/motion.js` toggles
`is-entering` on `.launcher-window` on every summon, which cascades the panel
arrival, the top bar, the placeholder overlay and the running-apps strip; the
launchpad keeps its own replay (`components/superactions.js`) because it is
built lazily. `window-shown` and `visibilitychange` both replay, and a short
guard drops whichever lands second. The same stale-buffer problem macOS does not
have is handled by arming the first frame on hide, so the frame the compositor
presents on the next summon matches frame 0 instead of flashing and rewinding.
Arming alone is not enough: the compositor keeps the last frame the webview
*painted*, and a hide in the same tick leaves the revealed panel in that buffer.
So every dismiss goes through `commands::hide_armed`, which emits
`window-hidden` and holds the window until the frontend acks with `confirm_hide`
from a double `requestAnimationFrame` - one frame to arm, the next to confirm it
was painted. A 60 ms timer is the backstop for a webview that never answers.
Each dismiss carries an id that `commands::show_launcher` clears, so a backstop
or late ack from a dismiss the user undid can't hide the window again.

Two constraints are tighter here than on macOS. Only `transform` and `opacity`
are animated, since they are compositor-handled and animating `filter` /
`backdrop-filter` tanks the frame rate on WebKitGTK. And the selection pill's
zoom uses the `scale` property rather than a `transform` function, because
`components/results.js` drives the pill's position through `transform` and an
animation on the same property would take the glide over and land the pill
without it. `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured throughout, except on Windows,
where the flag tracks the "best performance" visual-effects preset rather than
motion sensitivity.

### Config File Integration

All settings are persisted to `.look/config`:

**UI Theme:**
- `ui_theme` - theme name (catppuccin, tokyoNight, rosePine, gruvbox, dracula, kanagawa, kindle, liquid). Matched case-insensitively, and applied after the individual `ui_*` keys below, so a preset overrides them. Empty means Custom. Save Config writes a preset name only while the values still match that preset, so a theme you have tweaked is stored as its literal values.

**Appearance:**
- `ui_tint_red`, `ui_tint_green`, `ui_tint_blue`, `ui_tint_opacity` - background tint (0-1)
- `ui_blur_material` - blur style (hudWindow, sidebar, menu, underWindowBackground, liquidGlass). `liquidGlass` renders through `NSGlassEffectView` and needs macOS 26; below that it falls back to `hudWindow`, and neither it nor the Liquid theme is offered as a new choice in Settings. A value already persisted stays selectable and is labelled as unsupported rather than being rewritten, since normalising it would destroy the setting for the same config on a newer machine.
- `ui_blur_opacity` - blur opacity (0-1). On linows this thins the tint only when there is frost to thin: a background image, or a compositor granting behind-window blur. With neither it is ignored and Tint Opacity alone decides the window alpha.
- `ui_surface` - linows only. How surfaces are drawn, as opposed to what colour they are: empty (classic) or `liquid`. Stored separately from `ui_theme` because nudging any slider rewrites that key to `custom`, and a customised Liquid must keep its glass.
- `ui_font_name`, `ui_font_size` - font settings
- `ui_font_red`, `ui_font_green`, `ui_font_blue`, `ui_font_opacity` - text color (0-1)
- `ui_border_thickness`, `ui_border_red`, `ui_border_green`, `ui_border_blue`, `ui_border_opacity` - border

**Background Image:**
